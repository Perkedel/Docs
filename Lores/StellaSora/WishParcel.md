# Wish Parcel

How to remove gacha and permalock

ala Duet Night Abyss

## Describe

First, Trekkers & Tyrant acquires Wish Ingredients. That's Secret Clue. Lots of way to get them, either dropped by enemies, or event rewards.

Then, the Ingredients will be built into Parcel. Wish Parcel is a package built bespoke to the new Trekker's wishes.

The Parcel then be used to in Covert Commission. Once you win, you got a chance whether or not the wish come true, or fail. If fail, you'll get other items, otherwise the wish did work.

You need to collect Wish Come True for 30 of them. That's 3 win of Best come true (gives 10), or 15 dud come true (gives 2).

Now, you have collected all 30 wish come true. You can finally collect their soul, and the Trekker is now yours, **FOR FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** No permalock!

### Rotate

The Boss Blitz grants you exclusive Parcel for a period. When a period expire, the Parcel reward will be rotated across different commissions. Usually, rotates between Boss Blitz, Proving Grounds, and Cataclysm.

## What about Vigor?

Energy is still here. But here's the best part. That's now only to sweep. When you want to start commission sweep, you'll be given option how you'd like to do this. Because there is no Commission Manual, you just gonna get 1 type, the Vigor, to sweep that's it. If you out of Vigor, you can still play manually.

I think.
