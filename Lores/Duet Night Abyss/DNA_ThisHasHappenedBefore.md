I have once heard the story shared by Lady Nifle. The second session to be exact. In short, once upon a time, there is this boy seeking help yadi yada, and then the daughter of this nobleman realized something was really off, there's a huge corruption scandal going on. Got busted, she prisoned. And then what happen next, she theorizes brand new world stuff, which eventually led the Elysium Resistance, and now the Great Migration, then become Hyperborean once there is now.
Alas tho, despite all effort to make the `fork` of brand new freedom better than Elysium, only spawn more corruption from her own people.

This has happened before on original me, `JOELwindows7 (Original)`. We had Heartbeat community. The CEO is bad guy nowadays. Then one day, another member of the community set out to make the new house. The ***Great Migration***. Things went smoothly at first, but then about 5 year laters, things have gone wrong again. People forgot why they were here in the new house. They became so overprotective over what they share, might as well shouldn't have done that since they don't want to why half-hearted amirite. I was mad, I lost control. I announced it outloud on the correct room. Didn't expect they gone mad back, and kicked me out. I trauma. What have we become. See the similarity? **The fork, only spawns more corruption eventually it seems**.

This is all futile. But Lady Nifle knew it so. Whatever effort we did to make the cause, **is to cherish** it. Idk man, Me original felt this is still a bullshit.
So Lady Nifle, if you happen to see me, the `JOELwindows7 (Original)`, say that word to me again pls. Umm, I don't think asking my mom to soothe me evergoingly would be a great idea, thancc. She uh.. (`HEALTH_SITUATION_CHECK`) right now & I kept being discombobulated everyday.
