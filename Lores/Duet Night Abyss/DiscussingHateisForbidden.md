# Discussing Hate is Forbidden

Family guy moment

## Pre-cut

A: And even a Phoxhunter who takes commission to be a spy to The Forsaken, which contains even the nichest & most dangerous mission of all?

B: Absolutely!

## Begin

Eitsch: I found The Forsaken forum discussion set that talks about the community that ever betrayed JOELwindows7 (Original). I was just hunting for DOOM mods when suddenly a post linked a sauce to another Thread set.

Lancaster: Do not do anything. Just look, collect, and get out. I have been told (by the managers who read the commission file). If there is no smart, at least be fearful of the consequences of keep holding swords & guns, and slash fire hoping to hit the enemies.

Eitsch: They called out that **behaviour we've been trying to warn** but no place. Turns out God is still nice to Joel original He caused Joel to crashout and then got kicked out of it, before this happened.

Lancaster: (refuse to be reminded of the incident anymore & the suspect of what had came) Get out. That's an order. **The AI still wins**. Return to hunting DOOM mods.

Eitsch: Yes sir. I have collected more mods that's gone and refound by the members.

## Another

A: I saw the commission log here. Turns out there was another Phoxhunter who have been fond with another group. That Phoxhunter has been The Forsaken too, WHAT?!

B: Umm.. Remember, as being inspired by the Asphodel, we do not look background. And Obviously, causing war is waste of time when there are bigger issues we must handle.

## Begin2

Eitsch: I found and connected to be confirmed that a Phoxhunter who has been in this forum is also the member of The Forsaken. I advise attacks unecessary.

Lancaster: Then leave be. Wait for further instructions.

Eitsch: What if The Escort finds out? Not ***causing drama*** to the particular Forsaken member who is obviously visible lurking around normal forum will drop us to Lava Floor.

Lancaster: Return to my home.
