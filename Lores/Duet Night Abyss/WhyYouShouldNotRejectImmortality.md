# Why you should not reject immortality

North Cartessian. The boy who reject to live.

This Readable was left on his lab desk beside the lab chair after you finish the story.

It was written by our MC's adjutant, as seen in the cutscene.

Let me tell you a story. This was originally shared from Lady Nifle on her chat with JOELwindows7 (Phoxhunter). No, different guy, anyway:

There was this girl right here. her older brother desperate. Luckily there is a woman who got the power to cure her, `Golden Blood`. Long short he found her. Negotiation happens, eventually the woman agrees.
Now that `Golden Blood` applied, but there is a **bug**. It only pause her from death, did not remove her necrosis or something. So she forever had to be lifeless, but not dead. can't do anything, even her motorics are all down. Eventually, the only way this girl did is to.. you know. As Lady Nifle met her, she said `Thank you`.
Bruh moment right? The `Golden Blood` seems to be a beta version, forgor to remove the disease.

And you, my friend. BRO! You just got alived again, with **a rare buff of immortality straight out of the experimental mode**. **You did not immortal with necrosis like the girl did**, i.e. The Resurrector machine has no such bug anymore!, so fucking cherish it man! You wanted to threw it all away just because you were banned from your own community?! That's a waste of diamond! Here, I heard that **DNB is currently adding more RabbitHoles** just for you to try again. Of course, under strict protection from DNB, less likely corruption to happen. And if that's gonna happen, DNB immediately always found out.
So stop suiciding! Destroy that shit poison injector machine off of yourself, NOW! DNB is adding life again, and that's just for you man! thanks.

## Concept rough

Characters:

- Barmish. Boss of the bus boy
- Nyeol. Adjutant one. Stationary guy.
- Moil. Adjutant two. Organizer guy.
- Parim Pandora. the `boy`.
- Lug Pandora. father of Parim. Former CEO of Workshop. He told the rest of his worker to leave Pandora alone, and go to South Cartessian.
- Erem. mother of the Parim.

Barmish: Ugh... It doesn't work.

Moil: We already have traveled, scanned the area from here, totaling to 5000 Km square. ... What else did we do wrong?

Nyeol: (internal charging upset) 💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢!!!..........

Barmish: Umm.., Mr. Lug. Uuh, we have other ideas. This involves traveling outside the realm.

Lug: Yes?

Barmish: May we take Mr. Parim to Arenod Sediron?

Lug: Hmm.. Unfortunately, we are currently unconfortable bringing anyone off of this Realm right now.

Barmish: I see. But, you should ask the Parliament there. Perhaps they may have the lead you guys wanted?

Lug: My apologies. Uh.. Our house feels broken right now. Wee-need time.

Nyeol: (release) OARGH!!-THAT'S IT!. Boss, go back to bus, take the printer.

Barmish: Okay, (go head back to bus)

Nyeol: Is the paper & black ink ready?

Moil: Ready. But we haven't been using printers since 2 years ago. It may have dried up.

Nyeol: Fuck it, (take out Deck PC & attach keyboard accessories), You guys know that printer is Van Elektronishe right? Only model is the infuse type so that's should never troubled.

.

.

Barmish: Here you go (give), what would you like to write?

Nyeol: (receive), (put on the floor & connect now)!, Just give a sec. (open LibreOffice Write), (turn on Printer), (start writing message)

Barmish & Moil saw Nyeol began to locked in. Now they will look back to Parim.

.

Parim is still lying asleep, still with lethal poison injector he himself keep administering. Still does not get poisoned. Everyone is still unconfortable to force take it off, and instead wait for Nyeol's idea fruits.

.

5 Minutes later

Nyeol: (saved scummed), okay., (start print)!, (check layout)...., (begin)

Printing document

Barmish & Moil looking it printing

Moil: Oh wow indeed. It still work.

The text that come out is like still fresh out of the box. Deep black like new.

Nyeol: (take paper)!!, (take out unused envelope & put aside)!, (check document).., (fold it), (insert to evelope), (activate envelope seal & seal it)!. (take out pre-clayed stamp), (take the hot applicator), (press the stamp onto the envelope flap with the applicator)!!!........, Hah!, (flip envelope)!, (sign with his name)....! (give to Barmish) Right, put this on his table.

Barmish take & put the letter to his table. Hopefully he reads it.

Nyeol: Alright, (tidy up, close all apps)......., (lock the PC), (turn off printer), (disconnect printer)! Hoof!

Barmish: (take the printer from the floor), So, what else do we have to do?

Nyeol: We're done. Let's go home and report back.

Barmish: We only stayed for just 10 days.., 4 days off from what we planned.?

Nyeol: Idk man. We only had the same of this, beside... Real Estate already states, the worst minimum to be 10 days to us. So.. we're good!

Barmish: Umm..

Moil: We should just leave Mr. Parim again this time. (look).., Mr. Lug. Be sure to let us or the Real Estate knows if there is anything you need to tell. Do not hesitate.

Lug: Yea yeah. Thank you so much.

Nyeol: Okaeh, let's go!

The Bus Boys leaves the scene and going home.
