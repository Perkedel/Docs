# You You Misunderstand

Berenica & JOELwindows7 (Phoxhunter) encounter the original JOELwindows7. Things have gone misunderstood like in Rush Hour.

[I am you](https://youtu.be/dU4lYcN6zEY). [wha](https://youtu.be/OAVnOz7i-JA) [huh](https://youtu.be/EmojAVhmZwg)

## Begin

Joel Phoxhunter is heavily injured after beating the boss. That boss is extremely hard, 5 level above yours.

JOELwindows7 (Phoxhunter): Ugh... Ow...

Berenica: Are you alright? Can you still keep up?

J-Phox: Yes, We got the location..., (insert key onto the box)!!

Box beams portal

J-Phox: Let's go!

Joel & Berenica enter the portal to the Protection Tower

### Protection Tower spot

Days before, the boss managed to beat Tarron's ass who holds the USB Key until the supposed safe condition for his escort later. The Forsaken had gotten Tarron doxxed somehow, coz they knew the script teleports all Invaders from other universe straight to the prison per come from.

Surron Murray (son of the Chancellor Konrad Murray of Bottom Cartesian): Argh, shit! That fucking Key holds the location right in this tower. If ONLy!!.. only.. Those bastard..

alarm

Surron: Shit!, Prepare for fight! The Invaders figured out!

Context! The Forsaken & Filthoids have invaded Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Some new traitors from this Cinematic Universe have joined Forsaken right away. From the 2 and others have been, they fought not only their local enemies, but also enemies from here.

Berenica behind the door have been massacred the DNB soldiers out there. That's also because traitors includes oknums from DNB (hence the uniform) as well. Everyone flew to the roof in agonizing pain, as Berenica is like playing [Brutal Doom](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom?ch=1).

Surron: HOly shitt! We're having tough one! At the gate!

Berenica has finished all soldiers in this hallway. Now attempting breaking the door. Slice the door with her Consonance sword just Wedged with a Tungsten Melter. Stab!!

Soldiers inside draw their strongest arms.

melting

.

The door becomes hole

Berenica: (scanned, the New Forsakens are here)?, Alright. Move.

Surron: Not so fast, invaders.

Berenica: You better listen, or else you'd ended up just like them. Move!, I have the Key.

Fanos is Commander

Fanos: She got the USB?? How?, (telepathy instruct block her way)

the soldiers forms barricade keeping Berenica from moving towards the Protection tower.

Fanos: I'm not letting you go at all, Invader.., woman.. .., What if you brought in a Virus? Then you're also an Impostor Among Us!

Berenica: Didn't you just hear?

Surron: (telepathy & gesture simple) Fanos, don't let her engage! It seems she's too dangerous and too skillful here!

Berenica: I'm not a woman of... `diplomacy` anyway, (move an inch)

Kupic batoned Berenica's left knee outer side with his polearm.

Berenica: Aa!

Surron: SHIT, nooo.... Welp, (take out phone & then remotely charge turret) I'm hiding. (walk towards dressing bunkered room) I should've talked louder.. Good luck.

Fanos: What the hell are you doi-

Berenica continues Brutal Doom AARGH!!

Berserk continues in this room.

Gameplay vs. these soldiers, gone invincible after reaching below 75% HP. Survive!

Surron: Oh shit.. no good..

Surron reshocked like it was new, Berenica is unstoppable. Cancel hide, stay on place right by the dressing room door. Turret which already aimed to this room is still charging. If Surron had to keep waiting, they're all gonna decapitated everywhere already. Desperate, call Kaorfa Joel to here.

Surron: (PTT) Roger roger, Surron! 2 Invaders have infiltrated Protection Tower! Come here now!

Fanos thrown hard to wall

Surron: HOli shit, Turret charge too long! Over (release)!

Berenica continues beating their asses. They are constantly flying ragdolling.

While Joel Phoxhunter can only watch as Berry kept bullying the soldier since he is very huert, could only complain

J-Phox: Berry, I think we should stop!.., Perhaps they are not one of the Forsaken!

Berenica: Shut up! I'm working on it!

Joel Phoxhunter spotted opportunity. The Door to inside the tower becomes unguarded.

Surron: (Oops, the door is unguarded)?!?! Oh shit, (rectify by hastily return to the podium position)!!!!!... Nope, (take out Extreme Shotgun)!.

J-Phox: (now it's blocked again) Umm...

.

Joel sensei enters the scene from the dressing room door!

Surron: (saw Kaorfa arrive)?, KAORFA!!!

Berenica stop fighting. The Soldiers & Berenica already too exhausted, breathing gaspingly.

Soldiers tried hard to return to meeting stand up formation

.

.

Joel has scanned the mess going on here.

Joel Phoxhunter & Berenica come forward. Berenica still struggling to breathe after attempting to beat the Soldiers that gone invincible after below 75% HP.

Original Joel surprised. That is another instance of Joel from a different universe. He wears white outfit & has amber blotches around his body. Indeed, that's the Charon version of Joel, right in front of his face.

JOELwindows7: May I help you?

J-Phox: Kaorfa, I have brought the Key that you need we picked up from Tarron's bunker, now it's here.

Berenica: (Voice is different complete with weird accent, must be a low quality clone)!!!? (threat point slice to original Joel's neck) Who are you?!, `Kaorfa`?

still calm, because unless if real life people next to Joel, harms don't work, until he decided to simulate it.

Joel: Hm? ... I am... **him**.

Berenica: Just cut the crap. What's your name?

Joel: Joel. Joel Robert Justiawan.

Berenica: You must be still.. an `Impostor`.. `Amongus`..?

Joel: Folks, there must be a misunderstanding going on here. Calm down. I am the owner of this universe, and we are not Forsaken. Jo. JOELwindows7.. give me that key please.

J-Phox: (give)..

Joel: (take) Ugh.. (walk straight to inside tower to run the script) idk what to do.., Can't say it's bad idea asking someone's help in so dire coz these are all beyond my understanding (insert USB key)..., right?.. I wanted to do this alone (explore where's the script).... But they're too strong beyond my understanding. (run script)...............

.

.

.

The Forsakens have been teleported to prison. And the traitors from here everywhere teleported straight to every cell in Judgement realm.

.

Joel: Alright, it's done. clean. (back to stage)...... Okay, anything else? Btw, Berry. Were that blade were touched me, you'd be severely shocked. Coz I'm tungsten solid (Fictional character cannot harm the fanfic author unless author decided to emulate it). Unless of course, if that was my local people next to me (real life person threatening & then shoot). Well, don't worry about it.

Berenica is headached after everything so complex now is done just by the next

Joel: and.. another JOELwindows7. Have I met you?

J-Phox: Hmm? Me?

Joel: Do I know you?

J-Phox: I don't get it. You look same yet.. certain differences..

Joel: (examine).. Fascinating... Like the mirror. In a different being. Looking at myself, yet... still different. (telepathy scan).... (scanned past times) I've went through..

J-Phox: Umm.. can be said so.

Joel: (walk circle this Joel Charon) Something tells me.. feels like another occurence of appocalypse of futureyesteryear. Filthoids. Ethereals. Lampwick. Resonium. Phoxene. Polychrome. Wow..

J-Phox: Which mean we have fought together.., from.. distance?

Joel: More like so. Even further, Universe to Universe.

J-Phox: Wow... I thought I've dreamt just one.. mysterious boy, my half..

Joel chose also Male in the dual storyline, named him `Joel`. `JOELwindows7 (Legion)`.

Joel: I guess I fought that too.

J-Phox: (internal wow) Which mean..., You're the third storyline!..

Joel: Guess I could agree, when seen from your perspective. I've played so many stories here. Some had names & details like.. Zenless, others.. needs a name.., Stella, Duet Night

J-Phox: (brand mentioned) Hm?

Joel: Blue Archive... of that one is still me. idk. Except that `Dual storyline` which is broken home.. anyway, don't worry about it. We can't stress ourself with other stories, I think.. We have our own!..

J-Phox: Hmm...

Joel: Well. About your fight. (Duet Night Abyss has been EOS) That was long time ago. I was interested particularly because not only curious, it got a better system we could inspire from. and.. here we are. hmmf.

What about these Phoxhunters?

Joel: Well, now the war is over.. for now, I guess.. Maybe you can stay here for a while. My apologies. My universe locked down. Until the Impostor Among Us got cleaned off, you guys have to stay here. Btw, how did you guys come here? How in the world we got bunch of Filthoids? At least not Hollow with Ethereals in it tho..

## Flashback

???: (hand above button) Heheheheheee!!!

Lynn: Sir! You better drop that out. Or else, this entire world will-

???: No, (press)!!

Lynn: NOOO!!!

duar!!!

The Scatterment happens. Everyone flew out of this universe. Ended up in Perkedel Cinematic Universe.

## Finish flashback

J-Phox: `Hollow`? `Ethereals`?

Joel: Nah don't worry about it. or uh... **maybe yess**. And uh.. if you curious, it's very dangerous. Can increase.. **Deterioriation** rapidly into Filthoid Ethereal Hybrid

Joel Phoxhunter & Berenica gasp shocked hearing that

Joel: Don't worry tho, for now only 3 stuck in that **particular place**, I need to hire another people from the job of it just for it. You don't have to worry this one. For now have fun.. Where' you wanna go?

## End
