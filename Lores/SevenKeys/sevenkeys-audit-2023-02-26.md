well, we gotta tell them. so the.. this Audit is also the copy of this status, minus the message

## Godot 4

We are in process of transitioning our Realization system to Godot 4.

Please check our progress [here](https://github.com/Perkedel/HexagonEngine/issues/2 )

Realizer people are working very hard right now, pls give them support, by perhaps buying them some... snacks. Mostly they prefer truffle seasoned ones.

## Notary Revision

Okay, guys. um.. we have shocking news. Section Misfortune needs revision. Yes, we are not joking.

Okay, so here's documents we have published here in.. LBRY

- Last Funkin Moments. as side cutaway, & cameos

And what we wrote but not published yet,

- Fan continue sage ressurect misfortune from our Google Keep.

Yeah. So... Argh, where's paper? Hello, paper! Damn. Here,

So Kaorfa told me to take a look at the pavement on the right before Misfortune leaves. He especially pointed out the tyre skid before dad's car, Hernandez's car. Right? Some people said that, it's instead the car that crashed Misfortune. Okay, we think for a sec, and all of us including me agree this sense. It was, dad's fault. Not Albin's dad. Hernandez, yes, was drunk, did not see she was heading out, Morgo magically hid the car from her left & right scanning.

So, we.. delete scene the..

- uhhh
- Police interogation.. nnn, Change thaat a bit..
- Albin's worries..
- ah mdan

wow, that's really tremendous, but we tried to worry coz.. it's not realized yet. Hexagon Engine is still far way to go. ... yeah? yeah. Okay.

Well that's it. Also no idea should we keep the scene Misfortune rechecks the car that crashed Misfortune or something, coz now it's internal. Yea yeah.

Here's my idea. No crash, but Misfortunes. the pawn is now a... junkyard, huh, no difference. Okay, I think Kaorfa should see this. Kaorfa needs to discuss it this. This gotta be alot.

## Mass layoffs & Closures

Hear me out. This is heavy here. We are... laying off hundred thousand employees for Timeline Guard, Wakturia & also closing over 50 branches across galaxies.

Real, 1001%. I hate to tell you this. But considering we have received alot.. uh.. Tremendous.. of harm during our job there, notably in.. GameBanana, we're gonna explain later, we cannot risk lives of our people there, especially Kaorfa, as he could be banned, so karenly by non other than... mods. Look all we ask is why Mid Fight Masses gone, and then this smartass guy thinks it's childish. We always with manner but they just don't care.

So, we will... announce this, at later days. It gotta be done.

I'm sorry.

You're right. Perhaps, we should perhaps... like Surreal Meme ideas, instantiate our own. away from somebody's lore. Same franchise, same background, different story. Into the Skyverse. haha.

Okay, get it. `Why become weak crybaby so sudden?`? I know. It's.. idk. I mean, we often got the similarly same threats like this before, it's always fun, and entertaining, seeing our enemies get the discomfort we can control this flow every single day, till they give up and replace their prosperity with ours. It's different now. We become, afraid somehow, like cowards so sudden, I cannot understand. Probably that's because we think a bunch of innocent people that has nothing to do with us would also be killed. everyone in this universe could destroy, if we keep doing this. Sin or not, for God or not, it's... always bigger and more unethical threats, which is when the *fun*, ruins.

## Keyholders

Hey, it looks like Kaorfa could forget who are our names. I think we should tell our names here

1. Peoz (Red key)
2. Baofedan (that's me! I am the chubby one!) (Green key)
3. Destin Tumahead (Blue key)
4. Lakozh Pelde (White key)
5. Juktro Fazier (Cyan key)
6. Murin Elkatro (Magenta key)
7. Sol Bedth (Yellow key)

Also, for those who asking where is Black key, it's Kaorfa's key. You notice we cannot open the Seven Keys without Kaorfa, that's because he is the 8th & final key in order to access our storyline in Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Thank you for asking.

Oh one more! Yes, we are all boys. Please, we also have life partners. Okay, some of us right now still in girlfriend status sort.
