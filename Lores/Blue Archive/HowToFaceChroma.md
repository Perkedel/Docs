# How to Face Chroma

Concept. I must explore this story further, but ultimately, the lore officially seems to be undescribed afterall. Mysterious. Fuck it. Let's just fill it up for New Paradigm

## Begin

Characters:

- Chafi
- Karnand
- Reto
- Fual
- Jeti

Faction is `DNB Anomaly Response Team`

### A Classroom

Chafi: ...... Good afternoon, soldiers. So, this photo right here shows our friend that accidentally gotten into Chroma, and dusted. Rest in Peace. This is one of his last photo..

Karnand: (Catholic in the name of God, Son, & Ghost gesture)....

Chafi: ... as you can see, there's something shackling a figure there. Looks like... a man. Yeah.

Reto: üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?

Chafi: Yes ü´µ?

Reto: What effect this anomaly gives?

Chafi: Good question. I am just going to explain you a little bit. (next slide), this Chroma is mysterious. This photo is just one of the vague illustration. The one you would see, won't seen like it so much. Anything. And it consumes you. Faster than Hollow! Corrupts you worse. Unlike Hollow, you still have your body, but your mental is beyond recovery. Only way is... uuuhgm (neck cut)... stuff-.. like that.

*all*: (concerned).

Chafi: But I trust years of experience in our previous occassions should train you enough just for this one. What? this is... just a **Fear**, no? Hmm? We had tragedies. Happenings, and what it would be! So.. whatever that comes, would be nothing. ... Just nothing.-

Roof & wall torn, the Chroma expansion is getting close

Chafi: Okay, guys! This is it!..

*all*: (pray to God)

Chafi: Make sure your mental has been prepared! We're getting in!.

Reto: Shit! I hope my children has received my will!

Chafi: (check Shittim) ummmmm... It's did! all of your children & mine have read it! We're good now,

Absorption

Chafi: Hang tight!.. (loud) Face the fear!.. And embrace the scrutiny people have been always conspiring against us!!

touch the wall

Chafi: Accept that we are all useless, hated, undeserved,

*all*: (brace for impact)

Chafi: wished by all, never to be born ever!....

Chafi: ... (open eyes)... .. (feels like nothing)?.... Huh..?

*all*: (follow open eyes)

Reto: (noticed Hollow only ability actives) Ho, shit.. (W-engine lit up super bright 2000 Lumen) Whoa-??

Chafi: (feels like Hollow Minus One) Wow.. this feeling..... familiar... ... (confused).. what? ... ARGH focus! we're on mission! Get the to the core

Everyone runs find the core

Found. There's the shackling.

Chafi: Wow, that was easy. Okay, get me the Wirecutter.

Fual: (open sack)!

Reto: (start scouring) let's see what do we have here. .......

Found Wirecutter, a Mini PC with Character Complete 3D Model Generator powered by AI, ........ and autocomplete AI

Karnand: (bad idea) Wait what? We're using that??!

Reto: Uh.. idk why is it here.

Karnand: No!, put it back. If that gets used, we would create another scrutiny after we are done here.

Reto: Uhhhgh yeah, (put aside) let's see what else... .... (found another) Hmmm

A yet approved bill but sealed with MAX tier seal, about Author Dissociation. Yeah, nobody wants this real, because not only it would dissociate art from all authors, that includes Kaofa himself, and the one who agreed on it.

Karnand: Bro! what's going on here

Reto: (throw aside short) Argh (rescour) idk, this are all what do we have here!

Karnand: (pickup)!! ü´§, (examine)..

Patent of Surreal Blender Meme. To cope with unavailability of such 3D model to the public, and exclusivity to only those one shall approve. The patent highlights the character that are all made out of primitives & abstract shapes rather than commonly bipedic / humanoid, because we cannot find such tool that are flexible enough for all kinds, forms, & styles to this day.

Karnand: Okay, at least this one kinda fine, sir?, (throw) catch!

Chafi: (caught)!, Alright, let's do this, (cut)!!

Wirecutter fail, rejected. turn to dust

Chafi: Oh... didn't work. And it's first experience. .... ... Okay then,

Fual: Oh shit, the Wirecutters gone!.

Chafi: Hah? What do you mean gone?!

Jeti: I saw it. It vapourizes, Here Just.. 

Wirecutter `Move On` indeed vapourized in front of everyone's eyes

Jeti: Yep, it's.. sand.

Chafi: (disappointed)....

Chroma is shrinking while the outside expanding

Chafi: Time's ticking boys, find solution, or get out from here & abort.

Reto: Sir! (telepathy small info send & physically shout) Look!

Chafi: (look at pointed put aside wirecutters)??

Those 2 Wirecutters just thrown aside did not vapourize

Reto: I think the core wants us to use it!... That can't be right? We have to abort this. We cannot afford another scrutiny just because we legalize AI generation & Author Dissociation, let's go!

Jeti: It's blocked!

*all*: (devasted)!?!?

Jeti: Walls too thick! Fisures gone!

Chafi: (take both Wirecutters left)!!-ALRIGHT FINE! Guess what, there's no other way!
