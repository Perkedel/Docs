Arisu: Gacha for birth? Lmao, D, `Mendel`, final answer

✅ 250k! [Mendelian Inheritance](), is the inheritance calculation method discovered by Gregor Mendel in 1865. It calculates chances of product parameters of the source birth would output. It takes attention for 2 stage of process from uniformity, followed by segregation. Applicably, if e.g. 2 humans were married, their generation would have immediately go to the segregation step of this gacha, since both mostly would have contrasting parameters already.

> 4. C4H4NaO4

Taucho: Okay, this is your last

Arisu carefully contemplate examine the question

Taucho: chance. You lose, 100k. Walk away, 750K. Looks like Unfortunately you got a severely unrelated Question, but that's how Millionaire works, you know. You gotta be lucky if you don't know.

Arisu is scared again

Taucho: Here. Pls. Don't risk your life. But I believe you will not be kicked out, coz that's DNB Violation otherwise, reportable and punishable. So, it's your choice. what, 750k lets you buy.. ummm upgrades for your Sword of Light! Right?... Arenod Sediron people are scientists, they know how you, can upgrade those weapons. Don't want weapons? Games? Oh yeah, not only you can buy more games, Arenod Sediron has Collective Hires, where you can hire lots and lots of workers for your Game Dev department, for cheaps! You can hire millions of them, make games together and it becomes the best of the best you wanted to be? Sounds like good deal?

Arisu: (start chemical emulator, even tho the data has not yet been updated)!..

Arisu: (reverify the simulation)
