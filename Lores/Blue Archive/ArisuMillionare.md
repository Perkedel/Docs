Simulation Reward sidebar

Taucho: Keep doing this, until you won, the One Million Point. Too hard? Don't worry, we got safety for you. First of, 

mark first checkpoint

Tauhco: by the first stage up to Question 5, once you managed to win the 5th question, your cash, is safe. This, is your first **Checkpoint**. Then I will offer you to 

simulate adjust second checkpoint

Taucho: adjust where your Checkpoint you'd like to be, whether as early as 7thth, 9th, wherever, or even just before the final Million, up to you. Or you can leave it by default, 10th. That's simple. Next, 3 helps you can use during Questionaire, the **Lifeline**.

First Lifeline ding

Taucho: `50:50`. Remove wrong answers and leave just 2. And now only one of them is the Correct Answer.

Second Lifeline ding

Taucho: `Phone a Friend`. Call one your friend and have them help you answer. During this process, I will send out the question and the choices. Once your friend go, the clock starts with 30 seconds limit. It's up to you whether or not to use their answer.

Third Lifeline ding

Taucho: lastly, `Ask the audience`. The audience will help you answer the question by pressing one of the buttons on the remote, located under each chair. These answers will be collected, wrangled, and displayed
