# What if smart was lie

Like.. how Sensei is smart on most stuffs going on?

With the power of Shittim Chest & the Adult Card, Sensei becomes way smarter than they already been. Able to solve in average problems 50% much faster, & 10000 much easier than before entering Kivotos and acquired these technological marvels.

🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

I wonder what will happen after Blue Archive EOS all server.

If that technological telepathic augmentation ever exposed, wonder how those students would react. Found, that Sensei turns out was just an ordinary human, capable exclusively on what they've chose to become. If it's about Exacta Quick Mafs, it'd be very much unoticable for quite some time. Otherwise, it's shocking at immediate.

Me? I become IT Expert. I chose to become, and I am. Game Application Technology at Binus, finished 2021. And that's it. Nothing else. Even tho, the campus never provided me or I fail to choose the correct path, of the opportunity that allow me to show my true prowess. I can only manufacture stories. Sure, the Game Development Club can use me for it. But then otherwise, Arona & Plana will therefore have to keep me accompany at least a kilometer maximum so I can do something who knows I am succ at.

Thankfully, most adventures mostly do not involve said extreme Exacta Quick Mafs. You know what happen if one of them is. 

Even tho reading visual novel is boring, I still cherish the moment with these people. Admit it, some of them are very rambunctious, but I had sworn an oath just like the game when it's still alive, to never bitterness. I am succ at forgiving. But people of my world has been even less forgiving than I am, and loves to put the hatred to their grave. I saw it. I don't want be like this. What if it carried to Heaven and the angel measured those all? You can think this well.

I am sorry. I am not all powerful god. I just am human. Lost purpose because the supposed ingredient required to go to, is unavailable to this day.
