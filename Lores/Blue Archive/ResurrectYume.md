they arrived, their shadow of their shoes shows up from the bottom of screen.

look at emisary's right empty space. Lancaster rotate dial on his mic to a certain mode. Then press PTT for a half second.

A Spatial Portal opens. Remember, by default, Dasandim spatial portal sound like wire swiping through shallow water pool.  
It goes to a slot of a Loss-Found Resurrector machine.

The slot plunges the portable resurrecter out into this Kivotos area.

Lancaster caught and stopped its castering motion. Turn it on. Press auto start.

portal auto closes

The machine is whiring. Start scanning died people around. Immeidiately found, automatically turn its head into the marked crater.

.

.

Start querying where is her soul is. Pink beam shoots to the sky & bellow to find.

camera change back to look at crater.

.

The glow ray traces. Turns gold and the beam now only goes up, indicating she is in heaven.

Now machine fire resurrection at the primary nozzle. JERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR in gold towards the crater

fade slow transition audio and video onto the next scene

### Hoshino's house, bedroom

Hoshino is contemplating the empty but full of halos afternoon sky. Blank and lost for what to do after all these years. Graduated yes. The Game server is dying, and so it's now exclusively in maintenance mode. No more activity. What else?

Ayane: (press doorbell)!, ... Hoshinooo, Ayane.

Hoshino: Come in..

Ayane in. Walk to bedroom door.

Knock knock for politeness sake, open gently..

Hoshino: Got any updates?

Hoshino: There's no need to say you're welcome twice.

Lancaster: (close app) Right... ..., Aand I have a surprise for you.
