# Sodium Acetate Pad

Camping again. Sensei is recharging the heat pad

## Begin

Joel Sensei is boiling bunch of heating pads.

Joel Robert Justiawan: Students! Heating pads ready. Get yours one again.

Koyuki: (rushed in) Me first!! ... (take large one), (provoke the coin inside)!, !., (stick to front torso) aaaahh

Then followed by the rest of the students. Hina then come in and saw everything. She then picked the small one & reenact what Koyuki just did. It's fascinating.

Hina: Wuooaow..

Joel: Pretty cool huh?, I mean warm but yeah. This should suffice, coz we cannot waste more power until we get the data we need.

Hina: Huh.., How does this work?

Joel: Yes?

Hina: When I.. press the metal, it..

Joel: Crystalize..

Hina: and it becomes.. hot!..

Joel: (turn to Hina, head keep look at the boiling to remake sure) hah. ..., (and head now turn to Hina) Here lemme tell you story. So, (take pair of fridge magnets) take these..

Hina: (accept) Huum..?

Joel: It's like a magnet. I think.

Hina: (take these magnet appart)...!, (reattach)?, okay?

Joel: You know board game `Watch Your Magnet`?, where you must put one magnet carefully every of ones turn? It works like that, chemically.

Hina: (start getting sense) Ahh..

Joel: When you provoke, like giving some shock inside this liquid, chain reactions happens. Molecularly, the polymer shakes, causing them to attach to each other. It crystalizes. Spread until the whole fluid got solidified. This reaction is exothermic, which mean emits heat, that's why it can be used to warm something.

Hina: (95\% understood & 100% fascinated) hmmm....

Joel: It's not that efficient but... if you don't want to waste electricity, it should suffice.

Hina: And to unsolidify?

Joel: Well just melt it, simple. Higher temperature means more atomic vibration, and the *magnet* weakens, hence it turned back to liquid. That's how to recharge it, refill the thermic again.

Hina: I see...

Joel: Yeah, simple science for uh.. bizzare quirks. Sodium Acetate, this fluid is. An invention that demonstrate critical point thanks to it property in average room temperature. I can feel those Millenium students over there love to play with them, just look at them.

Yes, those Millenium students over there are pondering every pack crystalization every time.

Hina now has fullfilled with insight. Joel Sensei return observing the recharging.

Hina: (take large pad), (press the coin)! !., (stick to front body, minecraft villager hmm meaning smile of fascination) Hrm!....., (leave scene)
