# Bridge Physical

## Begin

2 miniature bridges. One is flat bridge, and the other arch curved bulge road bridge. These bridges are made of eva foam. Flat one is skewered

.

.

Joel Robert Justiawan: I have a simple trivia for you, Students. Here are 2 bridges. One is flat, and the other is bulged. Which one is strongest?

.

.

Weight drop!

Bang!! The flat bridge immediately crumbles. Its wooden skewer stick broke right ahead, while the arch bridge remained intact.

Joel: And fun fact btw, (demolish the arch bridge)!!, We didn't even glue the arch one. Just the flat is. I am not good at Physics, but you folks should be able to get the gist of why it's like this, (telekinetic reassmble the arch bridge like assembling temple stone by stone)....!, (demonstrate by swiping index fingers) There is frictions, (demonstrate point arrow V down, peace sign inverted where index goes there, and middle here) integrations, (other index finger point straight down) and gravity.

V down force. Imagine a load added above the peak of the bridge. It results force goes equally down towards other stones beside-bellow it. That's why it's V arrow force.

Joel: What do you think?
