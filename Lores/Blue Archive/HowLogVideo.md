# How Videos saved as Log

Joel sensei's short education

## Begin

On this table. There are 3 slinky springs of different thickness. Thin, medium, thick. These are inserted onto a wooden press jig. On the right is the hammer, and left is stationary wall. Rest sides are stationary too

Joel Robert Justiawan: Do you wonder how Videos are saved as Log? It's very simple, if you know what does it mean.

.

Joel: First of, why save to log? Didn't we already have HDR format? Yes. But remember, raw HDR format is expensive, and to this day there is no standard available to maintain it's dynamic range. So, we could only stick to what we have here now, SDR. But how do we preserve the full dynamic range information until it gets to the editor? They got it, (take out card of log graph) save the color logarithmically.

Logarithmic line. y = 0 is dead center (graph only show positive of x y axis). y running the line jumps drastically, and then slow down rising more y goes.

Joel: According to log, (point bottom belly) the darker have thicker onlook, and brighter (point peak), had thinner onlook. Here's slinky. So, camera sensor captures this much dynamic range. Once again, these are very expensive to store. What do we do, is log it, (push right hammer to compress all slinkies). NOw you see, thickest looks like this now, and thinnest is the least dominant now. That's why when you see raw log footage, **it looks gray**. And these all, fits in any SDR format, and is very portable until we can bring it to editor.

.

Joel: When it brought to editor, we must restretch the color back to original again. Assuming we have the log extractor info according to our camera, (pull hammer to uncompress) by implementing a restretcher function, the color no longer grays again. It looks as it is now. But watch, **here's the cool part why log**. Maybe you don't desire the default uncompression. You wanted to make it.. look different. With log, it is therefore possible to tune the uncompression, (adjust thick slinky so it's most dominant), I turn up the darkest, here's dark vibe. (reset slinkies & adjust thin slinky so it's most dominant) Or maybe... ..., Vivid vibe!, possible to. You can't do this on a pre-SDR footage. Must be log, i.e. all colors from the camera (Full dynamic range), no cut. whatever result keep the colors. So that's ... how log works. As long you have the original log footage, you can output more than 1 version you want. Pretty cool right?
