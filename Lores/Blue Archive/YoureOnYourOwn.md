# You're on Your Own

What happen after Blue Archive servers (both Global & JP) have been expired?

Select your Sensei login!

- JOELwindows7 (Male)
- Yourself (Choose)

Pls make the whole server & its moment downloadable from the time it premieres, down to its last legs drop & to the ultimately halo shatterings (shutdown).

[Here list you gotta watch](https://stopkillinggames.wiki.gg/wiki/Dead_game_list). [& campaign](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/).

## Begin

### A lab

Joel Sensei sitting in depression. After years teaching students, he already collected so many memories. Yet, such moments in collections were late, and so many moments may have been missed, gravely gone.

DNB has been hard at work restoring every single moments, from the main, & limited events.

## if Nexon disobey Stop Killing Games

Play piano sad song!

But alas, a corporation always thinks profits over all senseis

Arn walk towards Sensei

Arn: We have Bad news & Good News, Kaorfa.

JOELwindows7: Bad news first.

Arn: Unfortunately, as the Global server has been shutdown, years have passed without news whether or not we can download the whole server. We also couldn't find other related news about any other Sensei, who happens to have the whole server runtime.

Joel: 💢!..., Wow.. Was it great? Was good until it last. 

Arn: We are very sorry, for failure of finding download link of any server that makes it run & mod it all into all in one.

Joel: It's okay. Then I'll do this myself. If it's wrong (mismatch with the original moments), it's Nexon's whole fault.

Arn: But you would be shutdown too! We have no motivation of maintaining moments for it this endeavour! We tried, it's heavy!.

Joel: What do we gotta do now?

Arn: Hmmmh..

We can conclude that Chroma / Iridescense, were just the begining.

## if Nexon obeys Stop Killing Games || Sensei collected entire server moments

Play gacha song!

Fortunately, Nexon, despite being morons, still have *heart*, just for you all Sensei. / Fortunately, Senseis across all globes, beyond anywhere, have assembled all moments ever conceived in all servers, both JP & Global, put it all up, facing publicly, **without needing to join any of the group just to spread it out**.

Arn: Kaorfa!, Great news!

Joel: You found it?

Arn: Yes!, [Here URL](#). From the launch to shutdown, all events both main & limited & rerunables! Totaling up to (read the size on qBittorent table)... 400 TB.

Joel: Well then download it!

Arn: We are at 25%. .. yeah. That slow. We started 2 weeks ago.

Joel: Huuugh.... Here we go, `Internet cepat buat apa?`? **DOWNLOAD PORNOGRAPHIES**!!!, MORON.. You feel wrong with that, you should've resign, pack up, go home with oh so adored Fortuner shit. Right?

Arn: Haha, yeah.. aaaand, The clients... are on the way. 

We can conclude that Chroma / Iridescense, were just the begining. But despite all, even villains would have heart.

## Good news

Arn: On the other hand tho, our process of realizing body is almost finished. We shall have a look inside again.

Joel: (stand up & walk towards this lab door) Alright...  I'm sorry, I just order you guys that, didn't time to look. Dayum, since this all been, so busy, I hope you don't screw up, (sus if the worker used vesseloid when Joel orders not to) I'm afraid.

### Dynamic Lab 1

Joel & Arn walked inside

Joel: Okay. Looks like the setup worked well in here. Aand here the Arona & Plana yess good. Are these proteinic?

Werfy: No Vesseloid! These are... proteinic. Same one as.. Alisu (Arisu).

Joel: That's great!

Arona & Plana 3D printing body is at 85% completion. This medical 3D printer uses Gel suspension technology, that allows the printing needle to *print afloat*. It has precision movement & precission needle that such accuracy is essential. The filaments are liquid synthetic protein, glued with the same chemical mixture that composes human body.

Joel: Soon, you'll be able to interact with the world, physically. ... Power?

Werfy: Power is transfering. We also add more.

Joel: That's great. 2 & a half down.

- Reverse engineer students. **OK**
- Christian student. **OK**
- Arona & Plana. WIP 87%

Joel: Now. After this. .., What do we do now? Feels empty again here.

Arn: Idk. Now that the Blue Archive has ended, .... **you're on your own**.

Joel: I see. ..

..

Progress 88%

Joel: Uuuhh.... That's it. Monitor's good... We're getting close, (take out pad) here's the Shittim Chest., (press power) 

The Shittim Chest is lagging & unresponsive at times

Joel: I have analyzed this thing last night..., The components inside is similar to Apple's iPad, but such model, iPad Mini idk what gen specifically, has been long gone. We can't risk anymore damage to this thing, so what's new about the replacement just in case?

Werfy: Yes, let's see (retrieving mind).., uh.. Unfortunately, Fairphone still insist on using special purpose SoC for IoT purpose, which not strong, lack AI PU....., we.. only find that the only phone or tablet PC that's capable is.... just phone. Samsung Galaxy S? Ultra.

Arn: (disappoint eye arcing because since 2025, Google destroyed sideloading, & since long Samsung destroyed everything about custom ROM just to fit A.R.O.N.A & P.L.A.N.A. to it)!!....

Werfy: Yeah I know... that's the theoretical good device for it. .. So.. I... conceived, (show prototype)

a Prototype of RISC-V based Tablet PC. It has so many cores. 24 for compute & 300 small ones for AI. This Engineering Validation Test unit here was 3D printed beautifullly to be as well Design Validation Test. It looks similar to the newest iPad.

Werfy: umm.. yeah it's ugly. Arona & Plana has been living in somekind of ARM based architecture, and I hope they can also understand `riscv64` right here.

Joel: Ummm here. How about you phone it? Can you do it?

Werfy: It's possible, but you would also shrink it's power capacity, because we would shrink the battery to fit the device. ... What was your order?

Joel: Ah, Put these 2 OSes on respective bodies there,

Werfy: Oke oke..

Joel: The new Shittim Chest is remote.

Werfy: I see I see. ... The prototype is very hard to conceive tho. We tried our best but... it... the test kept crashing. Man, didn't know building [Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) is... haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard. I did followed the [instructions](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/). And [what proceeds after](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/). .... That last one. The test AI. man. ..... I also use anything [that would exist](https://archlinux.org/)... ... It's just the AI. I am sure both Plana & Arona can live comfortably btw... but... considering the fact of these circumstances here... I don't think this would gonna work easily well. We will continue what to do later, but, if the choice ultimately ends to be out of ideal, would you accept?

Joel: ...... idk anymore. At this point just get it working. These real Arona & Plana... brains. The phone, .. remote. That's it. .. (still disagree if that would ultimately ends up with `ARM64` or worse `x86_64`) I guess..

Werfy: Damn I'm stupid

Joel: No you're not. These circumstances is only the big guys (Intel, AMD, and more) fault. Not you, nobody here. Making device is haard. That's it. If ultimate, just fucking get any device Arona & Plana can communicate to. Should be fine 😮‍💨.

## Completed

Arn: Kaorfa? it's completed.

Joel: Okay, where?

Arona & Plana real bodies has been completed

Joel: (give pad to Werfy),

Werfy: (connect pad to prepared dock)..

Joel: Okay, moment of truth..

Werfy: Ready!

Joel: (run script).

The progress runs slowly

Joel: Oh yeah. Lightning slow. Haha... yep.

It is taking too long, all crews must leave the room. Don't worry, Saorfa lab is very safe, impenetratable.
