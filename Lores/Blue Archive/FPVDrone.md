> [!CAUTION]
> For best experience, requires 3D model cutscene. Incompatible with VN format!

## Introduction

Ef Pi Vi Dron event tells a story of a duo Efurteyas siblings.

One, the oldest, is heavily into Extreme Freestyle FPV drones. **Tasha**. She is pro at it, can fly it all fast and slip selap around obstacles. Whatever size, specs, she can do it. Tasha is very upbeat Student.

And the other, the youngest, while also droning, **is into matic drones**. **Yanti**. Flagship drones with bells and whistles, because to this day, no DIY drones that can have maticness from the flagship. Yanti is very timid Student.

## Early days

Chapter 1 / Enter the event menu first time. Posko Gaming Kivotos. The Drone Hobby Shop.

Before Joel Sensei encounter the Efurteyas duo, they were trying to enter the FPV rabbithole. Both ladies have experience outcomes, each with different result.

The two were taught the basics. Safety, how it works, what types, etc. And then the time comes when it's practice time.

Tasha excelled the manual FPV immediately like that pianist from around the 19th century. Tasha is locked in. Excited & tongue out

Reko: Whoaow, you're so talented at this! One day, you could win a draft at a drone racing contest there.

Then, it's Yanti's turn. As you can see, Despite using the best radio remote, Yanti had a very difficult time controlling the drone. She kept crashing onto walls, rings, and stuffs.

Yanti Efurteyas: AAARGH!!, (reflip & try again)

Reko: Don't panic! You can do this, girl. Everyone has different learning curve. Just... keep going, you'll do it!. (internal pesimist)... (glaze over that, convert to optimism) yeah!

Maybe that's why the market. **DJI** being one of the drone company, the first to create market for easy to fly drone.

Time's up. It's 15 PM now.

Yanti upset, smack the radio at the table

Yanti: (throw radio upsetly to table) AARGH!! (Walk away from scene)

Thankfully the radio is durable. Not even a scratch on its antennas, especially the leg stander antenna one even. RadioMaster T16S Mk. 5 has T Antenna & a plastic stand underneath that also contains the antenna.

Reko: WHoawhoah!.., Yanti? Yanti??

Tasha Efurteyas: Yanti! It's okay.. I.., I also

Yanti: WHAT?! How the heck did you able to fly so slyly like.., Mozart, Beethoven, whoever the guy was?!, HUH?? WHY CANNOT I DO THAT?!

Reko: Ehsts... .., (frown look down)..., Oh noes..

Tasha: Sir, ... what do we do?

Reko: Uuuh... (feel bad for about to select this solution)..., This shop... does not only... sell DIY Drones..

Tasha: (curious) 🤨?

Reko: We also have other types.,, `Aerials` too, not just `FPV`. And instead of leaving her loathe unmanned aircraft Rabbithole altogether, (left hand soup offer gesture).., (teleport demo unit of DJI Neo 5 with its remote & a phone)...!

Tasha: (more curious) Hmm?

Reko: It's... **Matic Drone**. Easy to fly, just activate, fly, and control like usual, but more stable.

Tasha: Like?

Reko: (right hand hold drone by its body bottom), (telekinetic prep remote and turn the setup on)..

> [!TIP]  
> DJI Neo 5 is still presumption as of 2026 following last recent release of DJI Neo 2.  
> We also assume the remote included in `Fly More Combo` package would still also basic, like RC-N series, without an Android mini tablet built-in like shipped on more luxury flagships (RC number & Pro).

unwind USB cable inside the caddy, underneath antenna phone holder combo. attach phone into the antenna phone holder. connect its USB cable into the phone. Open `DJI Fly` app.

Reko: (telekinetic turn on drone)

Press battery button once, and immediately again but hold.

Drone turns on.

Reko: (embarrassed with composure) (hold remote, prepare to fly the drone) Observe. (left thumb push left gimbal bottom right & telekinetic push right gimbal bottom left), (left gimbal slowly push forward)....

enter `Fly` menu, big blue button bottom right. do the `V` gesture to activate the drone. ascend with left gimbal Y axis up.

drone flies

Reko: (return the right hand back to remote & control normally)!., (fly normally around the scene)...

Reko fly the drone casually. Tasha is fascinated. Tasha calls back Yanti

Tasha: Yanti!! Take a look at this!

Yanti still upset. Try pull her back

Tasha: (attempt now) Yantiii..., (pull)!....

Yanti: What are you doing?!.!..

Tasha: (point the drone)!!!

Yanti: (look)??

The drone indeed is flying like professional thanks to its sophisticated algorithm inside it. Very convinving

Reko: (offer the remote) You wanna try?

Yanti: (stare Reko confusedly and doubtly)?......

Reko: C'mon, this one has sophisticated assistant built-in, even babies can fly it! Come!.

Yanti: (melting convince almost done)......, (take)!

Reko: There you go!.., Right, it's very same. Because the drone has stabilizer, your right gimbal X axis (horizontal) in effect will cause drone goes side to side instead of rolling right away.

Yanti try

Reko: See? easy right? Same goes with right gimbal Y. It'll make it forward backward, don't be afraid

try

Reko: Thaaat's it! Yess! Okay, now fly higher. Remember, left gimbal Y.

try

Reko: Perfect! Feel the left dial on your left, that's to tilt the camera, aim it down..

do it

Reko: Okeh, make sure we're all in frame, to switch to photo mode there's tiny switch camera mode beside right gimbal

press it

Reko: And let's take a picture, everyone say cheese..

press right shutter button..

Cekrek!

Reko: Naiice!! Land it by holding the `Eich Pause` there 5 seconds.

press `Brake / RTH`..

beep beep beep

Reko: Always remember to take over when needed, luckily the drone has Advanced RTH..

.

Reko: Good,

Camera tilts down to look at ground for landing

Reko: You like it?

Yanti: (ashamed has to fly matic drone) Ummm..

Reko: (telepathy scan says no, but let's tell otherwise to attempt cheer her up) I know you do!.. Would you also like to try flying it?

Yanti: HUH?...

Reko: It's also easy! Now look, it's already landed. Activate the drone first by pushing gimbals in `V` gesture, to in, or out, same.

Yanti: Like.. (guess Left gimbal bottom right & Right gimbal bottom left)?

activate

Reko: You're genius! Okay, just fly it slow

push left gimbal Y up

<!-- What do you think? so Tasha chose FPV, while Yanti matic. Yanti feel ashamed, envy. Mall. Mall forbid FPV but allowed Aerial. Yanti finally usable-->

Reko: Yep that's it!, Good! See, you can do it!

<!-- Intentionally glazed BetaFPV, because stock out and almost extinct. Do not presume DJI predatorize yet. -->

Yanti enjoyed this drone both glad & shame until the low battery alarm rings.

Neo 5 Drone: Battery Low, Returning to home in 10 seconds

click `confirm`

The drone returns to initial landing automatically

Jump cut to conclusionary. Reko recommends Tasha Van Elektronische Stork Alpha (alike Avata & BetaFPV), Stork Kolibri (tiny FPV), and Van Elektronische RemoteMod Postquarter (an EdgeTX Radio controller with ExpressLRS built-in); Reko recommends Yanti DJI Neo 5 (Motion Fly Combo, with Goggles and motion controller), DJI Mavic 8 (Complete combo).

Straight ahead, the transaction goes. Tasha pays all 4 drones packages and other accessories recommended, especially each bags to store them.

Reko: (while sealing up the boxed units) Would you like for me to set these up for you?

Tasha: Yes please.

Then Reko configured everything with the carrying setups. Yanti on the other hand setup her drones because DJI requires login.

## Story 2

Wait there's an extra here

After the Efurteyases left the store, another upset customer comes in again, to protest his problem. Splan did checked up on Reko's online store, and sure enough..

Splan Pokerman: (impolite door barge in)!!-(walk to cashier)! ! ! !, Sir!!

Reko: Welcome back. Did you got the item you desired

Splan: This is unacceptable. I remembered!, it's BetaFPV. And how in the world you still haven't had any of the stock?

Reko: Well uh... That one... I must firstly apologize that-

interrupt jump cut without hearing out

Tasha & Yanti each drone on an empty field.

Yanti disagree with herself. After already oriented now with her Neo 5, she immediately select Sport mode & try cruising as blatant as she could.

Tasha: Watchout, sis! Don't go overboard, we just bought this drone!

Yanti: Shush!, (continue droning) I'm training!

Tasha concerned, Yanti has been succ with manual droning and that's very succs for her.

Thankfully, the drone cruises smoothly like pro. Of course, unsatisfiable, DJI's algorithms assisted Yanti.

Level Complete. Free fly drone. Exit anytime

## Story 3

It's time to go to mall. There's a new X0p1r4t3 Eenvrnsmnt branch mall here in Kivotos. Let's get inside

As Tasha & Yanti gets inside, she saw a seemingly obviously fated sign

> Matic Drones Only!  
> No Manual Mode Allowed, Requires Matic Algorithm!

Tasha: `Matic`.., only?

Yanti: (disbelieve of being chosen to be a hero on a conquest) Huh??.. It looks like....

Tasha: (internal hillaried) Heh... okeh...

It just feels like despite of your succness doing manual droning, there's still a place that embraces Matic pilots, like it's to unshame those who could only be into it.

Tasha: Yanti, let's go. I wanna see something new.

get inside. Then as they reached the ground floor central hall, they encountered serveral entities having problem

Manush Caninos: (telephone) What?? You're out of city? Just now?

Reko: Ugh.. I'm sorry, sir. I was suddenly have to be called on an unexpected urgent missions. ... I hope you can beg your commissioner to postpone your quest.

Manush: No!.. I can't!! My client is prestigious, I could get penalty if I do that!. Who the fuck **else pilot should I hire then??** Anyone! I just need Aerial, that's all. 

Look at the newly occupied stall. The tenants who's Manush's customer are waiting for the aerial photo of the stall. In this floor, Stalls are dome house, which roofs do not touch the mall's ceiling. It's the domehouse vibe area.

Manush: It's to photo that new venue house over there. They asked me to take the picture with... **Mavic 8**! How in the hell would I get that?! I only had **Air 7S**!, that Mavic is expensive as hell!! ARGH PHUCK....

Reko: Argh damn.. if only I have a second keeper...

Manush: (close call)!!, (pinch nose bridge, hopeless absolute)!!.....

Tasha & Yanti get close to Manush.

Tasha: Ummm excuse me, sir. It appears you have a problem that requires a drone.

Manush: Oh.. hi. Who are you?

Tasha: Tasha, and this here is Yanti

Yanti tiny wave hello, shy

Manush: Uh.. yeah uh.. I was being called to capture this newly occupied tenant right over there. Alas, the drone store just a metre on that section there.. closed, owner on an urgent mission.

Manush: Yes!.. I need to rent **Mavic 8**, they asked for it, they want highest quality image for that stall there!. Ugh!!, so close!..

Tasha: I see. Yanti can help you.

Yanti: Hah?!, (look away)..

Manush: Oh.. umm, do you have Mavic 8??

Manush: Okay, so the customer over there, wants you to do these shot styles.

The paper has written what shot modes to do there in very detail, very according to how Mavic 8 does it.

Manush: I'm very impressed. How did they know Mavic 8 can do that. Anyway, just.. do these things. Each mission, 5 photos. And for video ones, just 2 takes. Easy. Go.

## Enterprise works

Yanti is monitoring fleets of drones. These drones has AI and are delivering items. Yanti's job here is to monitor and do takeover if necessary. Stork Cargo, alike of DJI Flycart & Agras.

Yanti is also doing observation works. Stork Recon, alike of DJI Matrice & Mavic. It is designed to be attached various types of accessories, and used to scout places. Stork Recon is smaller than the smallest Cargo, so it's more lightweight and fly faster. There are 2 variants of model: Flatleg (Matrice / Mavic) & FlexibleLander (Inspire).

## Whoops missing package

Reko felt guilty of giving Yanti DJI. Feels like an insult and select love. He then resolve it by providing vouchers to claim same set as Tasha's

Yanti then claim RemoteMod Postquarters & Stork Whoop Sets.
