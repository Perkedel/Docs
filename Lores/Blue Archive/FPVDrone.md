Short Story, Permanent (New Paradigm) Limited Event.

> [!CAUTION]
> For best experience, requires 3D model cutscene. Incompatible with VN format!

## Introduction

Ef Pi Vi Dron event tells a story of a duo Efurteyas siblings.

One, the oldest, is heavily into Extreme Freestyle FPV drones. **Tasha**. She is pro at it, can fly it all fast and slip selap around obstacles. Whatever size, specs, she can do it. Tasha is very upbeat Student.

And the other, the youngest, while also droning, **is into matic drones**. **Yanti**. Flagship drones with bells and whistles, because to this day, no DIY drones that can have maticness from the flagship. Yanti is very timid Student.

## Early days

Chapter 1 / Enter the event menu first time. Posko Gaming Kivotos. The Drone Hobby Shop.

Before Joel Sensei encounter the Efurteyas duo, they were trying to enter the FPV rabbithole. Both ladies have experience outcomes, each with different result.

The two were taught the basics. Safety, how it works, what types, etc. And then the time comes when it's practice time.

Tasha excelled the manual FPV immediately like that pianist from around the 19th century. Tasha is locked in. Excited & tongue out

Reko: Whoaow, you're so talented at this! One day, you could win a draft at a drone racing contest there.

Then, it's Yanti's turn. As you can see, Despite using the best radio remote, Yanti had a very difficult time controlling the drone. She kept crashing onto walls, rings, and stuffs.

Yanti Efurteyas: AAARGH!!, (reflip & try again)

Reko: Don't panic! You can do this, girl. Everyone has different learning curve. Just... keep going, you'll do it!. (internal pesimist)... (glaze over that, convert to optimism) yeah!

Maybe that's why the market. **DJI** being one of the drone company, the first to create market for easy to fly drone.

Time's up. It's 15 PM now.

Yanti upset, smack the radio at the table

Yanti: (throw radio upsetly to table) AARGH!! (Walk away from scene)

Thankfully the radio is durable. Not even a scratch on its antennas, especially the leg stander antenna one even. RadioMaster T16S Mk. 5 has T Antenna & a plastic stand underneath that also contains the antenna.

Reko: WHoawhoah!.., Yanti? Yanti??

Tasha Efurteyas: Yanti! It's okay.. I.., I also

Yanti: WHAT?! How the heck did you able to fly so slyly like.., Mozart, Beethoven, whoever the guy was?!, HUH?? WHY CANNOT I DO THAT?!

Reko: Ehsts... .., (frown look down)..., Oh noes..

Tasha: Sir, ... what do we do?

Reko: Uuuh... (feel bad for about to select this solution)..., This shop... does not only... sell DIY Drones..

Tasha: (curious) 🤨?

Reko: We also have other types.,, `Aerials` too, not just `FPV`. And instead of leaving her loathe unmanned aircraft Rabbithole altogether, (left hand soup offer gesture).., (teleport demo unit of DJI Neo 5 with its remote & a phone)...!

Tasha: (more curious) Hmm?

Reko: It's... **Matic Drone**. Easy to fly, just activate, fly, and control like usual, but more stable.

Tasha: Like?

Reko: (right hand hold drone by its body bottom), (telekinetic prep remote and turn the setup on)..

> [!TIP]  
> DJI Neo 5 is still presumption as of 2026 following last recent release of DJI Neo 2.  
> We also assume the remote included in `Fly More Combo` package would still also basic, like RC-N series, without an Android mini tablet built-in like shipped on more luxury flagships (RC number & Pro).

unwind USB cable inside the caddy, underneath antenna phone holder combo. attach phone into the antenna phone holder. connect its USB cable into the phone. Open `DJI Fly` app.

Reko: (telekinetic turn on drone)

Press battery button once, and immediately again but hold.

Drone turns on.

Reko: (embarrassed with composure) (hold remote, prepare to fly the drone) Observe. (left thumb push left gimbal bottom right & telekinetic push right gimbal bottom left), (left gimbal slowly push forward)....

enter `Fly` menu, big blue button bottom right. do the `V` gesture to activate the drone. ascend with left gimbal Y axis up.

drone flies

Reko: (return the right hand back to remote & control normally)!., (fly normally around the scene)...

Reko fly the drone casually. Tasha is fascinated. Tasha calls back Yanti

Tasha: Yanti!! Take a look at this!

Yanti still upset. Try pull her back

Tasha: (attempt now) Yantiii..., (pull)!....

Yanti: What are you doing?!.!..

Tasha: (point the drone)!!!

Yanti: (look)??

The drone indeed is flying like professional thanks to its sophisticated algorithm inside it. Very convinving

Reko: (offer the remote) You wanna try?

Yanti: (stare Reko confusedly and doubtly)?......

Reko: C'mon, this one has sophisticated assistant built-in, even babies can fly it! Come!.

Yanti: (melting convince almost done)......, (take)!

Reko: There you go!.., Right, it's very same. Because the drone has stabilizer, your right gimbal X axis (horizontal) in effect will cause drone goes side to side instead of rolling right away.

Yanti try

Reko: See? easy right? Same goes with right gimbal Y. It'll make it forward backward, don't be afraid

try

Reko: Thaaat's it! Yess! Okay, now fly higher. Remember, left gimbal Y.

try

Reko: Perfect! Feel the left dial on your left, that's to tilt the camera, aim it down..

do it

Reko: Okeh, make sure we're all in frame, to switch to photo mode there's tiny switch camera mode beside right gimbal

press it

Reko: And let's take a picture, everyone say cheese..

press right shutter button..

Cekrek!

Reko: Naiice!! Land it by holding the `Eich Pause` there 5 seconds.

press `Brake / RTH`..

beep beep beep

Reko: Always remember to take over when needed, luckily the drone has Advanced RTH..

.

Reko: Good,

Camera tilts down to look at ground for landing

Reko: You like it?

Yanti: (ashamed has to fly matic drone) Ummm..

Reko: (telepathy scan says no, but let's tell otherwise to attempt cheer her up) I know you do!.. Would you also like to try flying it?

Yanti: HUH?...

Reko: It's also easy! Now look, it's already landed. Activate the drone first by pushing gimbals in `V` gesture, to in, or out, same.

Yanti: Like.. (guess Left gimbal bottom right & Right gimbal bottom left)?

activate

Reko: You're genius! Okay, just fly it slow

push left gimbal Y up

<!-- What do you think? so Tasha chose FPV, while Yanti matic. Yanti feel ashamed, envy. Mall. Mall forbid FPV but allowed Aerial. Yanti finally usable-->
