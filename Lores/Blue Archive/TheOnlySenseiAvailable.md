It's official. You guys made it. Well done. Give applause to youselves,

Schale graduates in the front get into the position.

Seat lights RGB all zero!

Joel: So, To coordinate this, We have our students & our engineers, engineered the thing. When your light on your seat turns on green, stand up, get into this greened LED bar here, accept the items, and let me turn your hat string to your right. Easy? Basically, we're start from.. front left, into the left, and then the next column from right again to left. Got it? Let's go!

Midori: (press next on remote)

Tab: I understand your concern sir.

Yab: Rest assured, the younger Senseis will takeover. All of the candidates we trained have passed the license exam, and they are ready to be deployed in Academies around Kivotos.

Joel: Thank you. You did great. (sad, breath in nose)!!!....

Arn: It's okay. You made it all through. And so it's time to enjoy what we've made so far.

Joel: Yeah. ... Btw, have you found the lost President?

Arn: It's been years since the EOS of Blue Archive. Alas, the original storyliner has failed to provide good ending about this, before this all End of Service. But luckily, (show tablet) we got a lead.

A map marked the alleged last location of `undefined` the [GSC President](https://bluearchive.fandom.com/wiki/GSC_President).
