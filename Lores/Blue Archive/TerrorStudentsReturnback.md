### Arenod Sediron Portal port

Chafi: Okay. We are here now. What do we do?

Joel: Just wait.

Timeline portal from Terror Timeline opens. This one has rusted metal and opens with loud sqeaks

Chafi: OH (cover ear), Jesus Christ!

*all*: (cover ears)

!!

!!

!!

!!

!!

!!

!!

Done

Shiroko (Terror) & other Terror students are standing.

Shiroko walks out, followed by the rest of some Terror students.

It is all of the Terror students we've ressurected. Wonder why they got returned here.

an Egghead robot in suit greeted us & gave explanation

Egghead bot: Greetings, gamers. I am DNB Assistive Personel... Well, for *Terror Timeline*. We present you the Students that you have given to us 2 years ago.

Chafi: Huh? Wait. I just gave you 2 weeks ago!

Egghead: Pardon? Hmmm, it appears that your timeline runs at a different speed than ours. We apologize. Anyway, we have an important announcement as to why we gave these gifts back to you.

Chafi: Okay. I just asked.

Egghead: We are going to execute operation `Overcome`. Essential what it does is to finalize our proposed protocols to wrangle all beings across our universe to make sure they align with our goals. Ultimately, doing this slow is unviable. Therefore we forced have to remove everyone's right to deviate, at all cost.

Chafi: Wai wait. Remove **DETERMINATION**??

Egghead: Correct. 

everyone shocked, this is simply way too extreme just to retaliate against repeated DNB Violations.

Egghead: A few example of great talented beings have found to be very selfish and often times conflict with us, especially violating our DNB Philosophies, voiding our potential to go business with them. What a shame. That is all that we will do now.

Chafi: .... how would you do it?

Egghead: Simple, yoink not only the product, but also the factory, and then transcend into Union that further wrangles any possible talents that we could merge altogether.

Chafi: (way to far)?!??!?! You're going to force download everyone's brain, and then nuke the whole universe by trancending, so the mushroom cloud absorbs more talented people to prevent them violating DNB ever again?

Egghead: Exactly. Therefore, all in all, These students appears to be too precious to be included in the Transsendence. They've gone too alot, might as well leave part of them live a brand new lives since you have proven it. It's very compatible for them, but not at all with the rest of us Arenodians. 

Chafi: Uh..

Egghead: In case you wonder for the rest of Arenodians, you should not worry. 100% of us agree to be included. Also, (give holographic item) here's the address you can use to watch the feed for this ceremony.

Chafi: (take), (examine)....

This holographic thingy has alot of number in it. You can plop that into Anything Scanner, such as in an Auditorium room to read it.

Chafi: (doubt whether or not to watch it, Total Permanent Transendence is too scary as there is no way back).... Uh.., guys, if you don't want to watch it, you don't have to, this might contains gore, or whatever that even may not be a blood or what..

Students leave scene

Chafi: (examine again)...

all come closer & then face each other.

### Parliament Auditorium 2

jump cut.

Jeti insert the holographic thing into the scanner.

The scanner reads that there is address. The computer opens up the RTSP sauce in it and then broadcast it to the big screen

the Anomaly Response team now stares at the screen carefully paying attention.

### (Terror) Arenod Sediron Castle Balcony

Duron is on the balcony dictating the new announcement. Accompanied by his wife, Chalar (Terror) in usual Latex Suit purple. This one tho

Duron (Terror): IT IS TIME FOR THE NEW ERA OF CREATIVITY!

*all terror*: YAAY!!.

Chafi: (internal) Whoa, our majesty terror version?!

Duron: NO MORE DNB VIOLATION!, NO MORE SCRUTINY, ONLY DRAWINGS! BELONGS TOGETHER!!!

*all terror*: HUURAY!!.

Duron: Without further ado, (press button)!

Karnand: That fast?

### (Terror) some realm

a student mob woman is spruiously blocking fans she doesn't like. block block block block 

**BEAM CAUGHT!**, blank.

the patent papers lifts abductingly and moderately off of her head.

everyone's head content are being abducted

### (Terror) back again

Arenodians down there are very bright. Duron on the balcony is even brighter, maximizing bright of all HDR monitors.

overall. Over 3 trillion zettabytes of patent have been forced downloaded to everyone's brains here.

Completed. Now the process of Potential Violation removal by transendence.

Back to Duron's left hand. The finger dusts into bright particles. gradually whole body. All Arenodians also transencded as well.

Followed finally by objects. The Cartessian transcends.

Video stop. Camera is transcended too.

abrupt.

### back to this timeline

everyone's flabbergasted

.

.

.

Karnand: Well that was mediocre isn't it, Wait wait! I got feeling!

everyone connect to Karnand brain

### (Terror) Resume through telepathy

Now the Cartesian turns into blob. Cancer-like but it's glowing bright white iridescently.

The overworld where Earth is cannot transcend. Looking at the decayed city.

Blits of that white iridescent is blitting across the whole world scene. This indicates now Cartesian lives anywhere, nowhere, both at the same time. Lingering like ghost, downloading everything you've ever thought, abuse it, train out of it, and conceive new derivatives that everyone can use.

### yep I think that's it

disconnect

contemplate the cringeness

Suddenly, the white timeline portal opens. It got slimy sounds to it, in medium speed like it got too greased with water based lubricants.

.

.

.

There is a USB flashdisk in it. It floats onto this room.

door close. claps like thicc human thighs clap. USB flash disk drops on the floor like it suddenly lost its flying ability.

everyone even more flabbergasted with what they just saw.

Chafi: (go and pick the flash disk)...., (take), (examine a while)..., (raise flashdisk high & offer) Jeti can you please archive the content of this flash disk?

Jeti: (walk down towards front stage)..........

Karnand: Uh.. I.. I-I still don't understand any of this idea.

Reto: Me too, I don't have talking.

Fual: So.. they finalize revenge against.. selfish based blocking and whatever DNB is that for?

Jeti: (take), (return back to the computer at the top back)..

Karnand: Well basically that's the same as we are. Of course the Parliament scrapped this idea coz it's way too extreme. That's all what I can think of.

Fual: Oh man.. this is way too complicated. I feel I really wanna do it, but look at that just now.

Karnand: Yeah, don't worry about it. Now we see it,

Jeti: (insert USB flash disk to Anything scanner)...'

Karnand: We.. lost everything. Too much locked in is not good. Sensei's mom (Juliani) is right! We have to move on. ... Tho I also disagree. They got to be busted, again tho..

Reto: Even we got reminded again?

Karnand: Well what are we supposed to do? Example they betrayed us? Go ahead if you wanna sparsdat their art, but what can we do now since they wish no more business with us? That transendence is one of the way.. And that's bad.

The USB contains the patents & arts all ever conceived from start to the now. Everything is mashed together like AI, but instead by human hands which are transcended.

Screw this shit, too much to examine at, let's back it up! `dd if=/dev/sdb of=/media/audi1/ArenodPoolDAV/Intel/TerrorTimeline/TerrorTranscendence.img`!

.

.

.

.

Chafi: Okay, so.. what do you think?

Jeti: We got alot of inspiration we could use in this disk. But again, this is very cursed. The Terror people over there kills to get them.

Reto: Yeah, I really wish that we can get Realizers improve upon this, but I agree. This is very bad idea. It got bloods tho not innocent but murder is murder.

Karnand: And then, About the idea of the Terror.

Fual: I heard eventually it has to be done. We all know, there is always a better way. However, the possibility and viability of patience is considered bullshit these days, given the circumstances of this timeline too as well. I believe, this leads us to the same question. *Do you want to revenge to evade it?*. C'mon maybe we gotta move on and leave this alone once again. We'll wait until God answers.

Karnand: ... Yeah you know what? Let's just close this. This is way too much to think about.

Fual: Yeah, ... Maybe we really should fill our schedules with vacation if possible.

Karnand: Of course!, let's look at it (mind open schedule)

smart monocle show schedule. For the next few months all vacant

Karnand: Welp, You're right, we have lives.

.

.

.

Chafi: (examine)..... (finished), Okay so.. class dismissed, thank you.

everyone stand up & leave room

Chafi: And don't forget, if you have empty schedule, please, get Vacation! If the vacation tho is about.. this again, contact DNB immediately. You shall not be reminded again!

## Completed 🌸, last one. promise
