### Hikikomori County

Karnand has just finished quest. He has just arrived at his house. But all his families have been shivering outside for unfortunate incident in the house

Karnand: Hey.., guys.., what's going on here?

Kempel (dad): Oh no.., (Catholic Trinity gesture) niece Leona!!

Karnand: WHAT??! WHAT HAPPEN TO HER!!

*all*: (also do Catholic Trinity gesture & panikly pray wish God to not take her off immediately)

Moira (mom): Virus.. No..

Karnand: Virus?!?... Oh no... what did she do?... (reminding).... (she had quest on a small realm) Oh sh(**prevent!**)... (confused panik shiver left right) uh! ! ! uhmm, (can only surrender, try to jump but prevent because that's a new virus, both palm of hands grasp head) NOoooo!! (squat in leg turns jelly) no no no no no no...

Suddenly a Portal opens in the middle of the road. Ambulance inside rolled into this scene.

The Intelligent Construct got out and immediately take the

Hospital Driver Bot: Where's the patient?

Pontali (uncle, dad of Leona): (thumb point) Inside! Quickly!

the bots quickly rush to inside and then secured her on to the bed. Sound of balloon means the ward cart has been contained in a medical bubble to prevent. Mist of salt water cloud sprayed everywhere

Hospital: Stay back! 10 metres away! Now!!

everyone's run as far as 20 metres away from the scene

Karna: Hhh, hhh, hh, Pls, (Trinity gesture shivering again) pls... no.. in the name of God...

### Hospital

Unfortunately, getting this virus means your lung is permanently broke. Not to mention, the virus have extra features to damage other parts of the victim bodies. Fast is the only option, and surgery & extreme strength medicines are the only way to survive right now.

In the pre-surgery partition of surgery room. Bots are discussing. They looked hopeless.

In the meantime, other bots on different building just 500 metres away are building vaccine for this virus quickly. This hopefully should be easy.

Karnand: (on the call with his agency) Pleeeease, Give me the help, anyone you can.. okay? She must be okay after this.

Neshim M'neer: Do not worry, son. We'll get anyone ready. Expect the portal opening in front of you.

Karnand: (left hand feel heartbeat) OHh Thank God!!.. Pls be quick, the virus deteriorates her quickly!.. Be quicker than it!

Neshim: Yes son. ASAP

Karnand: (close call)!.. (jump right leg rapidly) Ooohh.... (bit the phone) SSssssss....

change camera to partition room. The bots has beens stand by in their Blood Reveal Green Robe. But they can't do anything since the lead surgeon is unavailable.

Guardian bot Alpha: This is very unfortunate. Talk about bad time. We don't even yet having any of the Top Surgeon hired here. Huhfh.....

look at her inside from this partition room, critical in bed, locked in bubble, debugging ECG shows deteriorating vital signs every minute, all after the partition over there.

G-A: Just look at her, (tear)...., (sniff back the right mucus)!!.... (whisper) Hahhh......

Guardian bot Beta: I don't have precision hands. Nobody of us. Huugh.. seriously. This bullshit politics (which is Difficulty of Sourcing due to bad reputation garned at that time during pre-meteor planet) had to be really gone simply right fucking now.

The rest of the 3 bots look at Beta & Alpha, signaling that it's still a fantasy. Ultimately, she will die like it or not.

G-A: Harrrrrgh....

Portal indeed opens in front of Karnand. a familiar student with halo walking in heightening stilts powered by nanobots, walking like sigma towards the room.

Sigma student bot: (knock)! ! !

G-A: (unlock, open & let her in)?....

the student is in

G-A: (close door), (lock again).

G-B: Excuse me, are you the doctor DNB just hired?

**Tendou Arisu (surgeon)**: (serious style speaking) Where is the agreement docs?

G-A: Uh.. sorry, we don't have one. This feature is not yet ready.

Arisu: Patient?

G-A: (point her upon partition window) right there. It's rapid decline, BPM 50, Oxygen 70.

Arisu: Dress me up., 

Guardian bot Charlie: Yes maam!, (quickly dress Arisu with blood reveal eye relax green robe, take the robe)...

Charlie is dressing her up

Arisu: Transplant?

G-A: Synthetic. Lungs & Heart organ, sourced from Arenod Sediron's Lab. And also the transitioner kits, the HeartLung machine.

Arisu: I hope she's fine with this..., Just in-case kits.?

G-A: Available. Defib & Telekinetic CPR.

G-C: Attire ready., Everyone?

*all guardians*: Yes!

All attires complete. Robes, Latex glove, and other self-protections. Now they are covered in the Blood Reveal eye-relax green full body jacket.

G-A: Let's get to it. (internal pray)

Mist of sterilizer desinfectant sprays to the entire room, using the eye-covering fog cloud as a transition to the next scene.

### Operation Room

Arisu is standing on Leona's right side, and the rest of the bots surrounds her. Circling from Leona's left Clockwise, Alpha (Assistant), Beta (handles transplant), Charlie (handles ECG Debugger), Arisu (leader), Delta (assistant), and Echo (Handles medicines).

Play Blue archive thrilling situation song.

Arisu: (x-ray scan)..........

The lungs & heart have been severely damaged. Fast operation is the only way. Nothing else broke.

Alpha opens the bubble dome that wrapping the patient Leona.

Charlie re-ensure debugging setup intact

Leona has been anasthesized, and the bubble has already open. There's no turning back.

Also take heart off.

G-A: (install vacuumer)

Arisu cleans the thorax space, remove the residual pordige bits.

G-B: (now open the transplant crate)!...

The 3D printed replacement lungs and heart looks very realistic. They are breathing and beating. Almost indistinguisable with the OG ones. But these are very sturdy, not made with a vulnerable material. Kevlar-like.

G-B: (crane these systems).... (grab systems politely)...., (grasped, now lift)..............

look at the debugger ECG. the waiting for stability this time, had to take times before Leona can be prepared for release, unlike usual. Everyone is getting bored, but that has to be done.

**time card 30 minutes later**.

the ECG shows vital sign stabilized. BPM 64 Oxygen 92

change camera to overall. The robots are sitting on chair, and charging themselves. While also form afar monitor the Debugger ECG attentively.

Arisu is still standing strong, staring at ECG, and intermittently, her face then back.

Until the vaccine is done, we must wait for a veeery long time much further.
