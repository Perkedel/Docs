# Return the students

It is time to return the students back to their original timeline. Turns out, that timeline contains an balancedly stronger DNB vs. the Chroma out there.

## Begin

Characters:

- Chafi
- Karnand
- Reto
- Fual
- Jeti

Faction is `DNB Anomaly Response Team`

### Sediron Secret Facility Dasandim Other timeline

Chafi: (telepathy) Okay guys. I'll knock the door. Stay alert, cover me!, (begin), (knock the thick metal instead of pressing obvious doorbell button)! ! !...

Suddenly the black void swiped the whole team

*all*: OAH!!

...

.

.

### Classified Sediron Interogation Room

black void drops all of them here. Now all sat facing each other in a metal dinner table. All of them were being cuffed solid onto the table surface

Chafi: (telepathy) Oh great. Off to great start. No sarcasm it's a progress tho.

*unknown ominuous adult*: Well well well. Look who we got here.

all team face towards that source of voices hiding in a darkening pathway. The adult is walking towards the hostaged team cuffed at table.

Reveal. the adult is this other timeline's Teddy Sediron. Younger brother of His Majesty Duron Sediron (other timeline)

Chafi: (surprised, that's Duron other timeline) Oh hi.., Teddy.. of other timeline.

Teddy Sediron: I see. Sly as always. An **impostor among us**, again.

Chafi: Um.. Sir, we got a business here. And I just confirmed that this whole place indeed matches the essencity needed for the gift that I'm about to offer you.. heh?

Teddy: (gently get close hands table, close omniously & threateningly to Chafi)....!.., you, must be Lieutenant Chafi, is it not?

Chafi: Yeah? uh.. that's me.. tho uh..

Teddy: and uh...

suddenly, a Lethal Bat swipes upon Chafi. swipe!, Swipe!, SWIPE!!, but Chafi & all already have Classic Shield the forcefield

Teddy: Hah.. Classic Shield. Prepared as always.., (rudely lift Chafi's chin)!!-But you're not our Chafi..

Chafi: I am not.

Teddy: Our Chafi is dead. Deader than dead. In case you are confused to why, We tried.

Chafi: Resurrection?

Teddy: Correct!-.., We did. Well, he was a victim to that mysterious being, when he was on the job. All his friend also dead right at that time.

*rest of this timeline's friend*: (shocked internally)!?!?!?!

Chafi: May they in peace ..., Iridescence?

Teddy: (yep, correct)?!??!?!, (teleport ominously from Chafi's right side to left & this time bang table with both forearm)**!!!!!!**..., (scoldingly pull Chafi's hair) NOBODY is telling YOU!!, anything about Iridescense, OTHER than Sediron Corporation & MY trusted agents for the mission. Unless... unless...

Chafi: (slight hint telepathy) umm..

Teddy: (received, Joel this timeline already did Chapter Final stuffs) Huhhhh... Of course..., you met Phrenapates. (reminded again, stress) ..

Chafi: (hesitant to tell truth that Phrenapates was other timeline's sensei here)..

Teddy: (rudely release)!!, Explain. What do you want?

Chafi: Uh.. gift. I'm going to give you.., gift. Return something that belongs to you.

Teddy: Fine. What is it?

DNB opens Timeline Portal right on the right side of the interogation room. Timeline Portal is thick. Unlike regular Spatial, it opens like metal gate, mystically also.

Teddy: IMPOSSIBLE!! YOU SHALL NOT (draw M1014 shotgun), OPEN PORTAL IN MY PRISON PREMISE!!

Chafi: Well it did.

Other students timeline walked in

Chafi: Look, here's the students. uh.. I was receiving order, thankfully my DNB briefed us what's going on.., Apparently, they're afraid if they keep beings from other timeline, it may disintegrate somehow. 

Teddy: (critically looking & contemplate them)...

Chafi: Thankfully everyone's fine.., but we don't take risk. And thankfully indeed, you guys have the strongest dungeons ever built. We're so jealous honestly. We didn't thought the need to build one back in our Dasandim.

Teddy: (contemplate look down)..

Chafi: Yeah, beside of the Sediron massacre, days still continues to be fine at Dasandim, aand.. new homes at Arenod Sediron.

all students have walked in. Close portal!

Not all student managed to be resurrected. Some are failed to unparaplegic somehow.

.

.

Teddy: Arenod.. & Sediron... heheh...

Chafi: What about you?

Teddy: The massacre.... I'm so sorry for you.

Chafi: NO no, they're fine. Chalar & Duron's fine, and rest others. Not the mental tho. We're similar too.

Teddy: Massacre.., they failed. We... had installed fortification.

Chafi: Called it, we should've had. BUt yeah.

Teddy: (hold pat hard)!!, yeah...

Chafi: But then what's going on? Did you meet your... Rumanod? and also Areluid who got lost eons ago?

Teddy: Huh. Yeah we did. Forgot how it was happened, but we met. They merged to Arenod, just like you.

Chafi: Oh that's good.

.

Teddy: After the massacre... we improved. Train more armies

Chafi: Wait. Train more armies? You guys military? Where's your social media?

Teddy: Ah.. it's now a side project, we got to focus this now. ... After we got armies, we fortified Daddy Hamlet. Too dangerous. Pull back my Hamlet.

*all*: (listening more carefully)

Chafi: 🫤..

Teddy: We... ***locked in***, yes. We now have power. Time to revenge. We're not satisfied. MOre, .. MOar!... nonstop!... and then... I forgot.. I was.. feels like possessed. My brother, Duron... is also conquering. Everything has been owned. Nobody dare to take it off. Buy it. And abide our rules. No more Harrassers. Harrassers will be.. Re-educated ah hah...

Chafi & friends locked in to listen even more

Teddy: And then a.... blank.... Until uh.. I forgot yeah... it's blank. Until... one day... We successfully retaliated, sparsdated all their files, and... disconsently... archive those... put those to AI training..... and a... There was 1 Harrasser we prisoned. They escaped. ... Idk how.. But looks like a sly exploit here, oh well, we'll capture them, we still have other Harrassers to deal with. Oh that was a big mistake. They are not Harrassers originally, it was one of our Traitor. They conCEived!.. that most dangerous things to ever exist. Thing that designed to make destiny of ending this whole universe.

Chafi: The Iridescence. Or on my house we called it Chroma.

Teddy: (still annoyed with recall) Uugh.. Y-Yeah. Correct. The Iridescence. Guess who first got hit? 

.

.

Teddy: Our king. King of Dasandim, and his only lady. .. (heart broken reminded of this) Heugh... That one. Still lingers out of nowhere. We must look our people right here. No more escape. Want to go to different world? Only Arenod Sediron. Through the Portal we provide, no else.

Chafi: How many Ball?

Teddy: One. (stress) It's out there!, on the loose!! They could be ANYwhere! This metal won't last long! We must keep relocating people the moment we hear rumors about it.


Chafi & friends already removed the Chroma from the [last episode](HowToFaceChroma.md).

.

.

Teddy: Wait... It feels empty. What's going on? I should feel stressed here! Did I got numb, (open iPhone 24 Pro Max),

Chafi: Huh? iPhone?

Teddy: Shut up. (open iridescense scanner app)...., You know, ever since you *took* Arona outta here to your house, maybe return that too as well.....

There is no more Chroma

Teddy: But uh... does it matter tho. You've already set a promise, you did it!, ... ... .. Something feels off. This time no Chroma detected. No, I.. I want to see it just here. Where? ...

Chafi: Ummm actually, We were testing facing the Chroma. Don't worry, I consented to the experiment. And hey, it feels like Hollow

Teddy: What hollow?

Chafi: Oh... You don't know? Don't worry about it. It feels familiar. Our... *Simulation*.

Teddy: Ah. I see. ... Did you just killed Chroma? The moment that you landed in my world. You setup a camp just by it. How bold..?

Chafi: Umm I think that's the one. We just landed on Dasandim other timeline, setup a fake classroom to attract

Teddy impressment is started

Chafi: Chroma. Oh it did work. Aaaan the rest is history. I know.. We used pesism trick to increase our strength and aptitude. That too work! Very different than Hollow then, but it's just the similar!

With nobody else to confirm than Teddy himself, He can only rely to what he saw on this radar iPhone.

Chafi: So.. Can we go now? Also advice. Why not you move all of the people to Arenod Sediron then? You said your Arenod Sediron is impenetrable..

Teddy: Nah, that's stupid. Good question tho. The dwellers right here are soldiers who consent to be enlisted. 100% of them.

Chafi: Wait, soldiers? Dasandimian, Arenodians?

Teddy impressment has been completed, but still doubt coz he cannot trust the soldiers just yet.

Teddy: Both. They all stay here for their personal reasons. That's the one. We have same collective goal.

Chafi: So uh.. what do they do?

Teddy: Just sit lazy, and do random stuffs, to confuse Chroma. Attack one, others retaliate. Attack another, we retaliate. More place better, but I guess just 2 (Dasandim & Arenod Sediron regionates) is enough.

Chafi: Hmm, interesting. Wait you said the Chroma to destroy world, I thought They supposed to destroy Kivotos?

Teddy: (brain touched, another confidential intel touchings)?!??!?! (but no more point of being offended) haeeh....., you see, Turns out Kivotos was just one of their experiment. Phrenapates... was doing his mission. Until, the Harrassers, Chroma, came. that's all. Everyone's dead. Left him, Shiroko.... and.. some comma and never wakes up. Also others missing, no more know of conditions, can't care anymore at this point. treat them as dead. How about resurrection if you ask, we tried yes. My Chafi, did woke up, but of course his mental.. destroyed. Feels like.. accused (do not say that word!)... eugh... *that*.., by the whole universe, even tho... you just teaching them. nothing else! Be a teacher yet still, I guess you know what I mean

Chafi: Yep, no point worrying that parable. And then, what next happen?

Teddy: He dies by the next day due to heart attack. His heart gone weak. We resurrected him, that fixes his heart, alas, cancer appears on his spinal cords, and then he died again. If forgot how many times we got to keep him alive, but everytime, a random fatal disease appeared, so much so.. **we forcedly have to let him go**, for good. And that goes to you all guys, my guys.

friends heart broken that their version ended up the same horrible fate.

Teddy: I don't want to go outside. Maybe it's time to roll the camp and go home. Leave Dasandim for good. While the Chroma is dead, but not for long coz many others will appear next. Thanks for the leeway, my soldier from other timeline.

Chafi: You're welcome.

Teddy: (open management app), (navigate to lock management)..., (unlock all locks in this table), (wait for FaceID)..., (press confirm)!

unlocked! Chafi & friends stands up to depart

Teddy: btw, just keep the Plana. Phrenapates is dead. And he wish no longer to be resurrected also. It is done. We do not need Plana anymore.

Chafi: Oh okay, thanks. I guess that's the gift for saving this world at least a bit.

Teddy: Yeah. I will go back to Arenod Sediron. We will go home. We'll prepare this up promptly. and... Thanks, for taking care of our students. I understand that it's not perfect. But having atleast these number is enough, better than nothing I believe.

Chafi: Yeah.. Great luck and God Bless you.

Timeline Portal Open. Ready to go home. Again, this thickness makes the Timeline portal slow to open

Chafi: If you'd like to visit us, feel free. Or need refugee, we're always open infinity. Yeah.

Students of this timeline walk back to dorm somewhere to prepare departure

Finally, can go home.

walk to portal, leave the students

however

Teddy: Wait.

Tommy Reddan: Huh?! Oh c'mon!!, (check energy left look down to screen)... Guys, (look back up) even tho we got 12 months left, it's too risky here

Teddy: Sir, h-hear me out. I believe you have to hear this. We must confess this because this is very important to you guy as an IT Expert.

Chafi, friends, & Tommy listens carefully

Teddy: The Phrenapates was like your sensei. Our Kaorfa.

Chafi: Wait, your Phrenapates... is Joel also?

Teddy: Correct.

Chafi: Well who would've thought!..

Teddy: 'course it's different instance, just the guy (Class) is same. When....

Chafi: Okay..

Teddy: Ever since the Community Incident, where his crashout though valid, makes him banned from almost all his places, **he retaliated**. He has contact to call who for this unwanted occassion. We were ordered to use a set of weapons that from the start is very illegal no matter what circumstances happenstance to be.

Chafi: (is it *that* weapon?) Oh no... what did you do?

Teddy: Wellh.... We got the files. Renders, 3d Models, and their patents & drawing styles, except the money, we don't need those. But at what cost?

Chafi: Oh shhit... you revoked that?

Teddy: Absolutely, he lost his mind. He has been there since long, one of the OG in-fact. and.... They're compromised. Now gets traded in black market (their identity & private keys). Including their parents and guardians. Cursed down forever by the generations. Well, those traitors got arrested, for this crime, and others we didn't know... but the subordiantes too, suffers..., and if not arrest, it's just their data played back and forth, **all shames, no privacy. All of them**.

Chafi: Jeesus CHRist!- On an Innova!.. Dude... ... ... And..., What next?

Teddy: We.. regretted this decision. He regretted. So..., He *played other games*. Trying to cope with his lethal crashout. He just killed 100k souls even tho are criminals. But that does not mean it excludes the don't knowing members off of it. They must've been struck too! 

Chafi: Oh man...

Teddy: Everytime... the Cardiophilia kept returned. He saw a character that has relationship to it. It reminded him of his genocide.

Chafi: Oh no.. no no no.. Mine didn't thought. I thought being betrayed is supposed to make my Kaorfa hates heart organ...

Teddy: Noo... it was.. the genocide. ... ugh... And... one flight.. goes to Kivotos. Yes, a president missing... yadi yada.. Chroma appears. We figured it out. Somebody who we arrested escaped. They exploited the time window chance to get in with the big power.

Chafi: And yes?

Teddy: They did it. They finished the revenge. They consumed Kaorfa. ... He was supposed to retire in peace. Leave everything behind. Doing something social. Helping somebody know something e.g., and maybe return the missing President once we figured out how. Oooh nope. Price has to be paid.

Chafi: (blow nose slight) hmmf.....

Teddy: Despite being so disfigured, he still trying to take care of his Shiroko, even tho murdered him, and... idk what happened next, but that's all, until other of you appeared. Another Joel, and.. his students.

.

..

..

..

Chafi: Well.. good to know.

Teddy: So please, I have 1 last favour to ask.

Chafi: Okay, go ahead?

Teddy: You must... force your Joel to live up to his age. And during so, forbid him to revenge to his traitors.

Chafi: Okay?

Teddy: Piracying indie games is okay. What most importantly, DO NOT, Doxx anyone.

Chafi: Of course, we don't want to.

Teddy: NO, you must take it seriously! Listen, DO NOT MAKE ALT ACCOUNTS, no whatever funny. If you had that, stop it from now. Use AI! Build your own Pinterest! It's bad I know, but you can give them the last touch, that's... the fucking key.

Chafi: ... Okay.

Teddy: (oh no my message too complicated already, Chafi will lose the context of this information!) Pls, just tell your Joel this message. ... I don't want your sensei turn to like ours. He's dead, could've do ZZZ stuffs, Ananta, Neverness, Doom, further Blue Archive, and more!

Chafi: Got it..

Teddy: Okay?... Pls... ...., (give Dasandim ID Card because this planet will be demolished soon) **Take care of your Joel**.

Chafi: (badum tss but serious) Huh, (take)-.... ... alrighty then. I promise. **Nothing fatal shall happen to my Joel sensei**.

Teddy: Thank you (tear drop)....., (leave the room)...

..

..

..

Teddy: (huh Chafi & friend is staying) Go! I'm going to demolish this planet!

Chafi: Ahgh, sorry

friends run hastily

Chafi: Okay... I'll see you... probably never.

Teddy: Yeah, sad but.. you cannot see us ever more. Cherish your students, and sensei, care them! that's all.

Chafi: ... Oookay.. (walk to portal) 

### Arenod Sediron Portal Port

Tommy: Welcome home guys. Dinners ready. Let's
