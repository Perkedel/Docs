# Northeast Top Cartessian

The Realm that flows with high amount of wild energy. It's an energy that gives you insight of wild things in the universe, somehow scatters and when you're here injects to your brain. So much so, not all people can enter this world. Those who cannot bear the overflowing insight will explode to pieces.

The sophisticated device worsens the intensity. Computer devices can hold so much informations, so these Insights tends to absorbs easily onto them, and then shoved into the user, causing the same brain explosion. The computer itself usually survives, only with a little overheat. Fortunately, the scientist have discovered how to shield yourself from such amount of energy, is to use a legacy technologies. 

It happened to be Commodore 64. Very cheap, and lightweight to carry and deploy. It's an 8-bit computer, that's way too old. So old, Insights are less interested compared to a modern 64-bit computers. In fact, it also found to shoo away the Insights as well.

## Well of Insights

The Well of Insights is the largest in the universe source of water. It is where you "doomscroll". Drink its water, or absorb just the Insights energy off the streams. Again, you have to use Moderator, which is Commodore 64 with the specially made Cartridge to download the Insights.

## Resurrector Problem

Unfortunately, due to this kinds of atmosphere, Resurrectors therefore are heavily bugged here. So much information related to death, reincarnation, reason to live, and not to live, and other going ons about life and death and beside of it. All mixed to one intense dust that's intangible. Insight does not care if you want it simple. Insight wants to complicate things. If you live, you get this and that, and if you chose to suicide, you get this and that. This becomes a huge intereference, like EMI. Corrupting not only the process materials and spirits, but also the target too as well if you're not careful. If somehow alive, the target immediately wakes up insane, because they got too much thoughts and worries.

Dry run or not, Resurrector does not have strong stopper before the update made for it. Once turned on here, it'll absorb everything anwyays, since it does not have the prevention system. It'll attempt to stop the machine, but since the information has absorbed, it's way too late already. Explodes to pieces, releasing the residual complicated thoughts back to the air.
