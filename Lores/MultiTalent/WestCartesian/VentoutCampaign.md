# Ventout Campaign

This special side quest introduces you how to grind for unlocking your Characters, weapons, etc.

in Duet Night Abyss, this is called Commission.

Requirement:
- (?) Unlock 100 Tips from Wandering Course Trader & play the final mission of 100th secret

## Begin

Lurge has finished slumbering in Concious VR. You remeet him again to ask his condition

Tommy: Hey.., morning Lurge. How have you been? You.. trauma still linger?

Lurge: I'm still not fine. Thancc. ..., I have acquired something tho, you might be interested.

Tommy: Hmm?

Lurge: I have requested you to buy yourself Concious VR machine, and for others. At least 3 of them. I know, I know, it's illegal, it's very risky to lock your conciousness projectionally onto a computer. If you just want the regular VR machine that's okay. But trust me. Projecting your conciousness off of your body is much better. Nobody will hear you scream. And if no internet hear you, you can stash it up until it's time to pour it out somewhere you don't like.

Tommy: Uh..m.. Why?

Lurge: Because God even always listened, saved your message, but the answer won't be given now. Obviously He does not answer to kill somebody but that's beside the point.

Tommy: ...

Lurge: (keep cam on Tommy) What I'm saying is. You can find yourself a replacement people, just for yourself. Then, you can have another existing teammate borrow it if they need so.

Tommy: How is that possible? Cloning..

Lurge: By thoughts. Without further a do, here (offer get into his house), I'm gonna let you try my machine, check this out.

Tommy: HUh? wai wai wait.

Lurge: C'mon, it's okay.

Tommy: (enter nervously)...

Lurge has setup the machine clean. Ready to use now.

Lurge: Just like tanning bed, but with bed, no UVs, and just.. forget everything you know about this cruel world. (use the computer by the machine), (check status).... Come

Tommy: Umm.., (lie down onto the machine) like..

Lurge: Yeah, like that

Tommy has lied down. Lurge close the lid

Tommy: (fear) Umm... is this safe? You said I'm gonna locked in like Sword Art Online..., Don't kill me pls, I'm the owner of this Realm!..

Lurge: No, it's safe! (checking suitable test mission for Tommy) Why would I kill you? Relax..

machine is ready to log Tommy in

Lurge: Just relax. Now, just the green button to login.

Tommy: umm.., (press the green button)..

.

.

ZAP! Tommy's conciousness pulled out projectionally.

Logged in

Tommy: (gasp heavily like baby out of the womb and spasm the lung) HHHHHHHHHH!!!!... HHH, hhh, hh,, what the?? Huh!?....

Lurge: Okay, pickup the tablet you got there, you gotta go to the category `Covert Evasion`.

Tommy: Uh.. Okay (press)..

Lurge: Here you presented 3 types. There are `Characters`, `Weapons`, & `Chips`. As you can see right now, we have the.. `Hordes` (Expulsion) on Character. Let's select that. Perfect timing.

Tommy select

Lurge: Start the challenge Solo. I'll give you these stash of Vent Posts. Just pick one.

Tommy: Let's see.... (choose `Challar Gupadi` because she wear full latex suit), (Confirm)!

Lurge: Huh? Her Majesty Challar, of Arenod Sediron? That's not a person should be replaced. She's known to be nice. But eh, whatever.

Tommy: Idk, I picked the sexiest one you gave me! I didn't remember if I had any grudges against who recently!

Lurge: That's okay. Once you've unlocked her, she can use any Whip Melee weapon you got and get huge DMG & Significant CRIT chances, that's her signature weapon type. Here it's starting.

## Entered

Tommy: I'm in!

Lurge: Welcome to ventout, **Hordes**. Basically here, just kill 100 Traitors. That's it. Very simple, that's why I recommend you get this, so if you can build Idle Farm, you can sit back.

You. Kill 100 Enemies to complete.

.

You have killed 100 Enemies. Mission complete.

VR Fades. Reappear the tablet

Tommy: Okay.. it's done. I'm back to the main menu again. I've won 10 Fragments of Challar.

Lurge: Very lucky. Well, challenge again. To unlock Characters, you must acquire total of 30.

Tommy: So it's 2 left? Okay.

.

You challenged Expulsion 2 more times.

.

Tommy: (picked Chalar one last time), Okay, won again! I got 30! Yay.

Lurge: Okay, you can quit now. Would you like me to log you out?

Tommy: No no, I think I can do it, (exit), (back), (exit Ventout)..

Logout

## Logout

Concious VR machine opened. Tommy awakes, right palm feel brain.

Lurge: So, what do you think?

Tommy: Ugh... Idk.. I can use this to train real battles?

Lurge: That's one.

Tommy: But.. Is it necessary tho? I mean if immersive requested... uh.. I basically don't like this idea of projectioning conciousness here. What if something went wrong here?

Lurge: I understand. After all this is just an experiment. DNB was experimenting with this technology on how to immersively drool oneself in their own world. Be it to train soldiers, or something else. And, I guess I can use it for one. But for you, It also seems useful too, you can get your own availableness of strongest people you can get without disturbing the original person. You can be reckless and remove dignity, which I absolutely don't recommend, unless such person again, is bad, idk. The ethicallity of this idea is currently under debate, but we can use it for the prowess of battle.

Tommy: Hmmf..

Lurge: So, just accept the buy approval and get yourself and your brothers one. It's useful. Go collect the stuffs you can use in your next battle.

## End

You have won 1 Character `Chalar Gupadi`.
