# Pause The Game

Open Menu tutorial

Now you can pause the game. When you open menu, and you're in combat, **it really pause the game**. Otherwise the animation will be kept running (no pause). This allows you to suddenly change setting mid combat.

I hope you guys implemented this. Don't patent it! It belongs together! Just credit Joel pls.
