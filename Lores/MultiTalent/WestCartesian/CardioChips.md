# Cardio Chips

Cardio Chips is combat enhancement system. It adds buffs to the user, useful for combats & other types of activities according to the applied chips.  
It is very modular, consisting of non-invasive base which has multiple slots where you insert the chips onto each.

There is a side effect tho. Each chip has different kinds of buff & the power, but also with greater power, comes greater cost. This is called **Tolerance**. Your heart organ can only handle certain amount of Tolerance maximum. If you exceed, the last installed chip will be disabled automatically for safety.  
There is a reason why DNB do not recommend replacing your heart organ with Arenod Sediron's made up carbon fibre ones only to bear maximumest Tolerance of every strongest chips conceivable.  
You can increase Tolerance by Leveling up your Agents. All Characters have have Tolerance the same Max BPM of their being. E.g., *Homo sapiens* is 150 BPM.  
Each chip has Tolerance required at base of around 50.

CardioChips is Duet Night Abyss' Demon Wedge is to MultiTalent. True Story, Joel like heart organ, and he is very glad that he found another aesthetic idea that involves beating heart.  
When in Duet Night Abyss, you apply the wedge to back, in MultiTalent you apply it to the organ inside their chest. You can get to see their beating heart(s), & hide menu and explore it. You're welcome., Assholes. You new gens, don't be like those predecessors thinking just for their own sake, anyways..

## Begin

Tommy went to Overseer office as a favour of one of his acquaintance. She was staying at Tommy's fortress, and Tommy overheard her conversation. The Acquaintance complained that the CardioChips system is flawed and put strain to ones heart the stronger the chip is, so the user must be careful of choosing the chips, or otherwise it will fail to work. Felt bad, Tommy went to the local Official Store of Arenod Sediron's licensed weapon shop nearby and inquire about CardioChips problem.

This is a tutorial about CardioChips. The Booster Card system you apply to characters.

Characters:
- Tommy (Main)
- Manny
- Benny

Renatta: (internal flabbergasted) ... My, .. Apology, sir.., We do not accept heart replacement unless it's emergency.

Tommy: Oh.. I see.

Renatta: I understand you are upset. We would like to offer you a compensation for having you disappointed.

Tommy: No, no need. I was just asking. Replacing heart just to toy up is absurd to me. Just uh... an acquaintance of mine I met couple days ago complained about your CardioChips system. I feel bad for her. She wanted to be strong, but alas her heart organ could only handle safe max 150 BPM around like that.

Renatta: Yes, we are still working on it: How to reduce Tolerance required to maximize CardioChips potential. And you are right, to replace heart with no emergency intention is a huge risk. Those made up hearts are also... *beta* (quote on quote gestures). We hope you understand.

Tommy: Living like this must be succ here., . considering.., we'd approach stronger enemies later on. Just neutralizing at least, gonna be exponential issues run ahead.

Renatta: Once again, (gesture) We are sorry. On behalf of Arenod Sediron family, and the whole People of DNB. 

Tommy: So, you got more suggestion?.

Renatta: Well uh.. you just have to build your configs well under your Tolerance. usually 10 BPM lower than yours, but if it kisses (i.e. 150 of 150), that's fine, there is lots of safety built-in there. We have.. the software that helps you calculate based on your body..- and the strength you built this life. It's like.., ***Pressing `Auto-Equip` button and the AI chose the perfect config based on your body condition right now***. Pretty cool right?

Tommy: Ah cool, where is it?

Renatta: It's part of the RemoteMod sir. The CardioChip base is also ECG. We have built mini-software for such model that allows you to calculate matching what you have and your body. Or, you can use the copy but Standalone version, here repo (give URL).

Tommy: (pick URL & read)... Huh., (examine Repo release page).. I see. Taking look soon.

Renatta: Use it well. It will help you to maximize your potential as much as it can go, while remain under the safe limit.

Tommy: Got it.

Renatta: If you have any other questions, pls don't hesitate. I trust you have saved our frequency. The usual. Support Center one.

Tommy: (locked in) Yea yea. thancc. God Bless you. (going to leave)

Renatta: Wait up! I think I forgot to tell you something.

Tommy: (Unlocked out) Huh? Yes?

Renatta: Have you tried installing the chips to your weapon?

Tommy: You mean?

Renatta: I must warn you, there are some chips that comes with a different format. Idk how did it get mixed, but you should also consider trying those different pinouted chips to other combat possessions like.. you guns, melees, and your signature armories.

Tommy: Oh.. How considerate.

Renatta: No problem sir. It was also our experiments after community request. You can't have it all in your heart, then why not the stuff too to keep add it?

Tommy: (intrigued & contemplate) Hmm..

## Try

Tommy has arrive home. In his bedroom, the shooting range compartment, Tommy is about to try up the advise Renatta gave regarding CardioChips and attempt at maximizing his power to his Tolerance. **Male Heartbeat moment**

You have finished installing the standalone CardioChips app. Tommy is trying the features and the AI auto equip.

Tommy: Okay.. so-uh... there is 8... 

Drag and drop whichever chips to any of these slots. fill 3 chips onto the slot.

Tommy: and.., wow, so complicated. Might as well try the AI immediately..

Press Auto Equip and confirm overwrite config.

Tommy: Cool. I feel my chest pulses stronger.., (felt his heart organ punched his ribcage from inside) Wow, it kicks ass, Jesus!. And also.. Ah.. different formats.

Move on to Tab of your other weapon. Apply few also to your Melee & then Gun.

Tommy: I think..-that's it!. Right. Okay..

Exit the menu. Tommy is going to hit the dummies!

Tommy: Let's see how strong I gonna be.

Control Tommy. Destroy the dummies

Tommy: Whoahoho... WOw!. well uh.. this is useful. I'm stronger now. (feel chest)....., (beating very strong, but still the normal) And hey.. my heart didn't explode.. . .. great...

Well, this is 12 AM already!

Tommy: Okay then., (remove CardioChips base), .... Good night.
