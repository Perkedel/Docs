## Begin

Characters:
- Tommy (Main)
- Manny
- Benny
- Lisa (to Tommy)
- Dana (to Manny)
- Gina (to Benny)

Keith provides the keyfob

Keith: The vehicle is ready sir. Van Elektronishe Exquisite (a large sliding door van model).

That car is very luxury.

Tommy: Wow.., (take keyfob & pocket it) Does that make me become the most arrogant politicians all the way up?

Keith: Rest assured! Our Church have blessed this unit too, so you don't become those politicians. (giggle leaking)!..

Tommy: Oh cool!.., ... hehe... yeah.

Keith: I know right, It's just a car. (offer gesture) Come, it's yours now.

Tommy: C'mon guys!

Tommy open front left door (door auto unlocks), wife go to front right. The 2 brothers takes backmost seats, so each wife takes the middle seats.

Tommy: What the hell? The chair is so steep!

Lisa: And my chair is too tall & too tight!..

.

.

**Realization**. The Steering wheel is on the right.

Tommy: (confusta)?!?!?... Wait a minute.. HUh?

Keith: Excuse me, do you have any problem?

Tommy: Uhh, the Steering & the pedal is on the wrong place. It's.. it's supposed to be here..??

Keith: Ah, my apologies. You see, in this new world, we now drive on the left.

Tommy: Oh no, fuck!.., Uh.. I really.. really sorry. I've got networking schedule been bottling me up recently, I failed to often attend my own place therefore. Argh shit..

Keith: It's okay sir. While you left for the important job, we did exactly what you said, of course in guidance of DNB, per the rule you've agreed and signed when you bought this realm. And as you can see, (offer point the steering wheel) DNB makes their car with steer on the right. For context, driver must sit closest to the opposite way division, to ease up U-turn procedure. Circle Racing therefore have this rule, instead of CCW, now here CW, so the racers sits closes to the pitstop area.

Tommy: ... Oh wow. I.. This is surreal.. .. .. Never in my life have I.. experienced this.

Lisa: Maybe you should drive. I'm afraid. I am not familiar with this side of driving.

Tommy: Yeah, let's swap, let me take this.

Tommy swap with Lisa.

okay done close door again

Tommy: Okay.., Uh.. (press START/STOP)!.., Oh, an EV, (Hold brake + START/STOP)

Car will IGNITION when hold Brake + START/STOP for 3 second. hold. .. . . . ON

Tommy: Oh cool, simulated engine sound. Okay, (seatbelt) I think we're ready. 

All seatbelted

Tommy: Where do we go now?

Drive the car. Open world car driving

## Gameplay

New Quest! `Call for Venting`. Visit Plumira Stadium.

Keith: (open video call)

Tommy: (Answer) Tommy, come in.

Keith: Alright, sir. Your next quest is to go to our new venue stadium and greet your potential folks you're gonna hire. There is an expo held where cool people shows their cool gigs of every kind. I have sent you the location of the venue. Remember, we're driving on the left. So pick left, don't get wrong, you'll get used to it.

Tommy: Ugh, why can't we just violate DNB for this time?

Keith: I'm afraid this is bad idea sir. Because DNB requires owner of realm to be compatible and unified across all Cartesian. The DNB and the peers in it have agreed to make driving lane on the left, because it was inspired by our Kaorfa. Mr. Joel is Indonesian, and in his land, people drive on the left, and so the steering is on the right. Just like... Dasandim.

Tommy: Dasandim? Huh!. Since when did we there before, I now forgot.

Keith: You were a baby (actually toddler, already acquired biped walking) back then. Taman Seru was just grand opening that day. You took all 12 launch rides!

Tommy: Aaah... dang, I missed that day. Alas transport getting expensive and Time Piece Powered Ship has been banned in my planet. Fucking hell.

Keith: Rest Assured. Once we're done for today's mission, We will add appointment for your old days. We are very fortunate that now there is a new realm at the Northeast Middle Cartesian, called Vacation Realm. Those were originally a place of our old planet, but moved there and make it bigger.

Tommy: SGTM (Sounds Good To Me)! I appreciate that.

Keith: No problem. Please report once you have arrived. Next briefing to be given on the target.

Tommy: Acknowledged!..

Keith: Alright, see you soon. Over and out, (end call)

Tommy: Huh, dang, left handing the controls are very difficult now. Who should I blame tho.

## Level Complete

Keith: Great, head in to the Side Venue No. 09 (zero nine). Zero means Ground floor, and they setup the place at the 9th, right side from the big center one where if you entered from regular main lobby. I have given the path on your XR.
