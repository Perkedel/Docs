## Prologue

Purnirap sitting on tree, mourning.

And then, the son spirit arrive to Purnirap. Looks young but hair is gray

Kroman: Father?

Purnirap: Son?!, (rush)!!, (hug)!!!

Wait... Kroman is ded.

Purnirap: (but dead).... Well.., look at you. You finally dead. Guess the world seems very cruel to all. We are done for.

Kroman: What do you mean dad?

Purnirap: You're very sick. And now you died. I'm sorry son. I failed to get the medicine you needed. The god of Accident was hired by the god Demon to kill me, so you dead afteward.

Kroman: Huh? Dad! What year is this?!

Purnirap: 1991. Next month, I should receive large sum of bonus as an award for my hard work! I was almost there! How's there now?

Kroman: ... The company bankrupt. Luckily, I bought it in 2010. We merged it, and.. we're good now!

Purnirap: (year) Two thousand... What are you talking about? You're dead. I failed to get the medicine!

Yep, Purnirap is time stuck. Dead man tells no time. Especially the longing ones.

Kroman: (sigh)...., father, take a (give the Update Memory Documents) look...

Purnirap: (take & examine)....

Kroman was then rescued by his best friend. The medicine was indeed delivered already, right after the incident.  
Now Kroman has been cured, and continue on his business.

Unfortunately, the Purnirap's office, Deliver Center goes bankrupt because of a national political screw ups. Kroman's company on the other hand switched function temporarily to unscrew the politics going on, and successfully turmoiled the politicians that caused all this mess.  
Right after that, Kroman bought the poisoned Deliver Center, recleanse it, and then eat it. Beside, Kroman's original business is also no longer trending, coz the better one already consolidated somewhere thanks to said political reform, and Kroman must adapt it to the new functions anyway.

Now, Kroman's company is a huge success. But there is a new problem. He has been very old, and will get age illness soon. So he trained all 3 of his sons how to continue the company. It works, the first will be appointed as CEO, and the rest handles each of 2 departments.

Kroman has been died in 2050 at age of 122. The descendants handover procedure has been executed successfully. New friends has come onto the business and stuffs keeps being delivered from and to for the realm, for times to come.

Purnirap: (felt too good to be true)......, What is this son?... Must be a lie (`hoax`) here. Tell me. What was the most interesting thing happened during your life?

Kroman: Umm... (scour brain) let's see..... Ah! Fidget Spinner! You have to see it but... (felt something appeared in right pocket) wait, (pick that up), (that's it!) Here, Fidget spinner. It's a toy, that is a ball bearing wheel attached to these 3 weights, triaxially symetrical arrangement., (spin)!!

Purnirap: (fascinated) Huuh??

Kroman: (give) Here here, (attach its center to Purniraps right thumb & clasp at right index so to hold that spinner) Hold its center, and then spin it!

Purnirap: (about to spin like he did)?..., (spin)!! (intrigued) heh!!?

Kroman: See?! It's cool right? Very treasure, and very viral, back in 2017 to 19. We even had to home so many employees coz there's just way lot of orders, didn't get to rest well coz if not we delay. So, we have to get ourselves a robot to handle the extra influx. Rest history.

Purnirap is very confused, such new things is now tangible within his grasp & real. Nothing like that in 1991, beside maybe... TV plugged in Consoles and Computers? Such toy is way too new for him to perceive as his thinking of time. And therefore, everything's now solid. **His son did not die**. He lived on, to his full destiny, complete with the followups for times to come.

Purnirap: (stand up in contemplation, confusement, and regret)!......, (look around)...., (look left)........, (look right)........., (look down to fidget spinner)...... ..... ...

.

.

.

Purnirap: (talk is ready).., I.... I've wasted alot of time.

.

.

.

.

Purnirap: What am I even doing here? .... Could I have just traveled back?....

.

.

Purnirap: Oh yeah. ... I happen to be can't. .... I worried too much, so much my ability to travel has been... damaged. Now I can only sit next by my body. Argh..

.

.

Purnirap: If only... Only.. I knew now... ... This.. only because you want me to be free right?

Kroman: I told you, father. It's not fake! Look at the calendar!

Purnirap: It's blur

the Calendar dome projection is now clear. Right when his son is by him (actually the Resurrector's Memory Update feature, we'll talk this soon), his eyes opens wide now he can see the world

Purnirap: Huh??! .. How... Two Thousand..... **Fifty Five**?!?!?!?? (forehead-palm shocked) Hooolee....

Kroman: 👍👍👍👍👍 (thanks Guys for the Resurrector upgrade)!!

Purnirap: Haoh..... .... ...

.

.

.

Purnirap: You know what? ... I should go home. (sniff)!!!.... There's no other place than go to Heaven right? ... That's why I stay, to wait for you.

Kroman: Thanks dad, but you should've gone there now, we can rendevouz later, and Heaven probably has a service to see me what we're up to now!

Bruh moment! Heaven is heaven, and they always had everything bruh!

Purnirap: (bruh moment) Ah, haha.... argh, stupid me!!, UH..... I didn't missed anything right? Nothing's new on Heaven except..

Kroman: When there is Rapture, is that right?

Purnirap: Yeah. Nothing, but sometimes later. (felt wasted time, when could've lived much longer in Heaven until the issue resolved) What am I even doing??..

.

.

Purnirap: Come (offer hand)!.

Look hand

Purnirap: Let's go home.

Kroman: Yeah, (take)...

Purnirap & Kroman walked together towards the HDR maximum light.

And so, they left the universe, and live happily ever after at the heaven.

**HOW THIS IS HAPPENING?**

## Begin

Characters:
- Tommy (Main)
- Manny
- Benny
- Lisa (to Tommy). can manipulate materials atomically
- Dana (to Manny)
- Gina (to Benny)

Tommy was invited by a Judgement Guardian for a commission. There is a man since long time ago lingered on a tree in the graveyard subrealm. Actually a transfer, but anyways, the man has been longing his sick son, when unfortunately during job (to get fund of cure) had accident and died. The car when he was going to the apotech before going home, crashed a reckless bus driver (bis oleng) and gibbed him to jelly. His son must've been dead then? Right?

Goltress: (open strong door)....., Okay, right this way.

Tommy: (enter graveyard dome).. Hmm...

Goltress: Here's your client. The ghost.

Tommy: Okay, let's see if I can talk.. umm

Goltress: Don't worry, the ghost is prominent, you can communicate, but of course, his line is very limited.

Tommy: Hello, sir?

Purnirap: (look) Huh?... Uh, hey.., You brought someone.

Goltress: Here's the consultant you've been asking. Now, please explain the brief to our consultant here, Tommy.

Purnirap: Simple. I need to know how's my son doing. The location is on the paper over there.

Tommy: (look at the paper), (pick up and examine).....

The son was last seen in a Sorting Center located at realms far away.

Goltress: Dead man tells no tale. We couldn't bring evidence here. The only way was is to make him alive again. We did tried, it failed.

Tommy: Have you got all the power?

Goltress: We did!. But yeah. Not all tragic death can be resurrected as we expected for a Resurrector procedure. God, just what the fuck.

Tommy: Hmmm.., maybe... if you.. don't have to resurrect. Try bring him to the place where he wanted to see?

Goltress: Okay? How do we do this?

Tommy: Something like, The resurrector downloads the spirit to be then injected once the body is complete. I wonder, where step you failed?

Goltress: When rebuilding his body. I think it's been too long time he died before Dasandim reached to him.

Tommy: Yikes., but also.. could be.. outright rejected by the Heaven in any case. So, with that process in mind, how about we just pause it there?

Goltress: (intrigued) Hmm?, pause at where?

Tommy: Forget building the body. Just put him into the container of the Resurrector!

<!--
try to carry him. oops, range limited because purni worried too much

dig the gib too? Forbidded! bacteria can spread!

then bring kroman!

look back to sorting center. Oh Kroman is dead, age! must discuss secretly, Purnirap cannot hear he is dead!

Okay download Kroman! What?! download died old from heaven????
-->

Goltress: You mean... vacuum that ghost into the machine? (fascinated) Okay, you got a point..

Tommy: So, let's tell the Resurrector to add this feature!

### Arenod Sediron Science Lab, Resurrector Department

Tommy & Goltress explained.

Vitamin: (thinking)..., Okay, This should be trivial. One minute

Tommy: Okay!

Vitamin assembled his friend and start making the feature. The feature of Vacuum to storage will be installed to the Loss x Found Resurrector.

One minute later

Vitamin: Here's the Experimental Firmware. Now, you have a mode to succ the spirit into the machine. Also, we have added another experimental feature, which we call, `Dead Man Tells a Tale`. So, with any procedure active at any circumstances while this flag on, the spirit can have thick memory of things going on within this Resurrector Machine. Also you can even interact with it and provide however many intels you want as if they're alive. Just.. be careful using the flag & this new feature, okay?

Tommy: Don't worry, it's for our client. He really longs for his stuffs.

Vitamin: I see. Well, great luck & God Bless you..

### Return back to Graveyard

Tommy: Let's see if this work, (start store the spirit )!

Purnirap: Whoah, what's happening?

succ

Purnirap: WHOAA!!

Now Purnirap is in the Resurrector.

Goltress: Wow! It works! Okay, hang in there, (open thick portal to the Sorting Center location)!

!

!

!

Goltress: Okay, sir. Pull him onto the office!

Tommy: Here we go.., (push towards the portal)....

But then Purnirap pinched as the resurrector enters the portal. The Resurrector also stops by it.

Purnirap: OAOAOAOA, I'M CRUSHED!!

Tommy: (panik pull)!!! Oh shit.. what the hell?? HUh??? There's a colider? (verify by waving the portal lip)! ! ! !??? Nothing?

Goltress: Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you, He can only go as far as where his body goes. And that's around this Decorated Grave space of his.

Tommy: Weah... What if his body fell deep down? Urrgh... Gotta think something else..

Goltress: (close portal) Hmmm.. what is it do we do then? AHh, Uh.. maybe.. carry the body too!. I must negotiate, one sec, (take the HT)

Tommy: Okay.. That should do it.

Goltress: (dial the frequency bookmark to the Graveyard officer) grave grave grave grave......, (found) Ah, here., (PTT), Roger roger, Goltress Mobile Officer here. Requesting procedure of mobilization of the body named Purnirap, over (release).

.

.

.

Tokin: (PTT) Roger, Tokin. Unfortunately is forbidden, all no except. Bacteria can spread, sorry, over (release).

Goltress: Argh shit, not once again?, (PTT), Acknowledge. Thank you for help, Over and out (release upsetly)! UGH.... Nope!.

Tommy: Hrrrmph..... ..

.

.

.

Tommy: How about his son now?

Goltress: That? Umm.. Come here, (immediately walk to the enclosed meeting room) follow me.

Tommy: hmm?. .., (follow)...

### Enclosed Meeting room

Goltress & Tommy sit close by at the presenter side.

Tommy: Okay. Now let's talk.

Goltress: The... Kroman. Son of Purnirap, has been dead. About a couple years ago.

Tommy: For?

Goltress: Old age, his descendant now continue. Problem now is, we cannot tell Purnirap that his son is dead, any circumstances. The keyword of fear was `Want to see son alive and well`. ... aand.., yeah.

Tommy: Huh.. That's inevitable. Well considering he's dead of the old age,

Goltress: We cannot resurrect anyone who's dead of old age. It is very forbidden & if done is unethical.

Tommy: But his dad business is unfinished! Maybe.. uh... this is the same unethical, but... hear me out. Just do the Vacuum spirit again, but instead we just download the sone, not including body. We can ask Heaven these specifics, they'll be more lenient about that this time.??, Right?

Goltress: So you're saying, Download Kroman from Heaven? Instead of Resurrection but to Reunion? ... Yeah, I thought the same, it's still bad idea, Downloading who shall rest, back off the Heaven?

Tommy: It's the only way, if we dormant this issue again, who knows what would happen in this premise?

Goltress: Yeah, **we're not turning this whole place into an Indonesian Horror Film**. .. You should think again tho, Is this gonna cost and consequence so much?

Tommy: ... Just treat it as desperate situations.

Goltress: Well then it's settled. I'll get my friends first.

And so it began.

The friends have been assembled. Now go to the Sorting Center.

### Sorting Center

Tommy & friends is at the house that's now a company museum. Here's the bed where Kroman took his last breath. Aim the resurrector at the Bed

Tommy: I hope I don't disturb the business there, I just need to reunite this guy back to father. If you please.., (start)!!!

Success, the Heaven lets you borrow Kroman.

### Back again to the scene

Now beam Kroman into the Purnirap's grave space. Unsucc!

The rest of the story goes as in the [Prologue](#Prologue). Little replay, and skip to the after Purnirap & Kroman disappeared by the light, indicating they've arrived at Heaven

Then

Goltress: (wipe tear)... Argh... Fuck... This moves me... I am a man.. This is embarrasing..

Tommy: Uh.. it's okay. Nothing like that is embarrassing. I too despite no tear, still felt.. internally.

Goltress: (take out phone) Okay so... (open wallet app & NFC prepare send the much) payment as promised (pin confirm)..

Tommy: (take out phone), (unlocked the phone & offer NFC receive)..

Goltress: (tap Tommy's top of the phone)!,

Tommy: (accept)..., (pin confirm)...

Success

Goltress: Argh, I'm sorry you got to see me like this

Tommy: Noo, it's okay, nothing's cringe like that. I also tears alot even already 25. Idk why, the world is very stingy to me.

Goltress: (relieved he's not alone) ah-Okay.. thanks..

## Level Complete

If a Bullshit school ask moral of this story, answer it with:

Trust Heaven. So you can see the whole world, including your son. Basically **don't overworry** on stuffs that's inevitably perma-failed idk, or else you'll turn to Wishen or whatever Linger Ghost thingy instead of resting in Heaven idk idk idk idk idk
