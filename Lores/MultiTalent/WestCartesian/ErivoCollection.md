Tommy: Aah..!, okay.

Choose Which item to deliver!

- Cross Stab Shield. Customer `Boruhed`. A chest plate that's enchanted to block heart organ from being stabbed by any type of stake.
- Intentionally Burnable Holy Bible. Customer `Uurley`. A special working Holy Bible but made of fuel paper, therefore can easily burn. The regular physical book from DNB is made of durable paper that's fire proof and any-disaster proof.

Tommy: Alright, I'll take this one.

## Cross Stab Shield

> [!NOTE]  
> Spoiler alert: Male heartbeat moment incoming

Tommy picked up order pack for Cross Stab Shield. He then go to the address shown on the sticker. It is Somewhere Picnic Table. Anytime the order detected by this table, the customer will come.

Boruhed was told by his mom to asap buy Cross Stab Shield, because the day is getting closer and everyone are paniking. Since Burley family are Vampires, they are subject to such kind of bullying and murder.

Tommy: (sledge legs into the length chair) O, iyah! Alright, (butt sitt), Here we go. It's right here.

Boruhed comes to the scene in classic vampire bat particlings

<!--Burley-->

Tommy: ... Excuse me, Package for.. `Boruhed`.

Boruhed Burley the Vampire: Ah yes!

Tommy: (give)

Boruhed: (take) that's me. Thank you., (unbox with nail to tear the tape)......

The Cross Stab Shield is here with its brand new pristine

Boruhed: Aahh, (immediately apply magically atomic passingly as if for the next second would be the stab)!!! 

a Little Flash shines for milisecond on his chest. It's now invisible. The shield embeds on Boruhed and now his chest is protected. The plastic wrapping got separated off and lied on the table.

Boruhed: (relieve) Hoooh.... ...

Tommy: I'm glad you enjoyed it. If you have any question, feel free to ask Erivo for customer support.

Boruhed: Wai wait! I need your help.

Tommy: Alright, sure. What can I help you?

Boruhed: I that true, I have a heart? My family kept living in dilemma whether or not we have a heart. One day, a friend of mine got stabbed by an Entitled on her chest, and then melted and die. Don't worry, she's been recovered, and the Entitled has been arrested for manslaughter. Point is... if we got stabbed in chest, why we die? I thought our heart does not beat, like Appendix, so blood flows by magic. Am I undead?

Tommy: So.. you asking me, if whatever inside your chest is beating or at least squirming for something, is that correct?

Boruhed: Yes.., We don't get to try some testing tool to confirm our heart existence. Those tool were hard to get!

Tommy: Huh?!, wait, how.

Boruhed: No, don't worry. That was long time ago. But now we afraid. What if this new doctor found we indeed have no heart?

Tommy: And then caused chaos in the Crossban?

Boruhed: Crossband?

Tommy: They have hospital too.

Boruhed: Ah!.., And yes!.

Tommy: Hmmmmmm..... Perhaps I can check it up on you right now. No doctor.

Boruhed: Huh?

Tommy buys Stethoscope Coin right ahead magically and drop the box onto the table. Unboxed the wrapping sleeve and take out the unit.

Tommy: Okay, so, this is the microphone coin (offer the unit).

Boruhed: (take & examine)

Tommy: (take his own steth coin) All you have to do is, paste the silver side towards your chest, like this (phase the coin through his clothing to paste the unit onto his left part of center of chest)!.

Boruhed: Hah., (repeat),

The steth also phases onto Boruhed's chest.

Tommy: Okay, you should now connect that device to the phone and see it with a recording app.

Boruhed: Okay, (unlock phone), (pull down right side bar), (advanced Bluetooth), (pair that new microphone)...

Connected

Boruhed: I just need to see the recording that's it?, (open Audacity), (ensure the microphone is the device).., (start recording & see)...

It got the wave!!

Boruhed: (surprised, stop recording)!??!? Wait.. no way.

Tommy: Okay?

Boruhed: (play recording)?

**Male Heartbeat**, It indeed a humanoid heartbeat sound, but has 3 of them.

Boruhed: (confusta and glad tearful moving) 🥲 Ooohh..

Tommy: Well then, (take out Xray Flashlight), (aim to Boruhed's chest & press its butt switch to turn on)!

Indeed, inside that ribcage has 3 heart organs. All beating at different rates.

Tommy: Well would you look at that..

Boruhed: 😱😱😱😱😱😱?!??!

Tommy: Congratulations. You have a heart!., umm 3 hearts.

Boruhed went locked into the trance. He got confidence now, using power to listen to his own heart. Feel left chest with right hand.

Tommy: Well, guess I'm done here. Don't worry about the coin it's yours now, (leave business card). Now if you excuse me.. (stand up ledging legs off the table)... Ugh, (stand up successful), Leave scene

Michelin 3 taste!!!!!

Tommy: Mm... extraordinary?

Urrley: (appreciate) Hmm 🙂..

Tommy: What's going on? You look sad..

Ureley: It feels bland here. No matter how delicious I could hold or cook anything, without my family here, it's... lonely.

Tommy: Oh. What happen (eat again)?

Urrley: My families busy. Each job here, and other job there.. .. The world forbids them to day off. And if there is, they can only stay at the office, coz.. its mission comes suddenly.

Tommy: I see. What about you?

Urrley: Just finished contract. Sailor, logistic.

Tommy: Ah. And?

Urrley: Even I have co-workers there, I feel mismatched. All they think whenever they chat, is about Christianity. And uh.. War.. to uh.. kill Palestinian if not wrong and then... Desecration of

Look Tommy

Urrley: those people who... lacks Christian actions. Baptism and more. Yeah.. racism in religion. They love to watch that kind of content.

Tommy: Heuh... How you hold up?

Urrley: Pretend..?

Tommy: mmm...

The BBQ that was just used. It did not emit lingering smoke despite the most intense power used.

.

.

Tommy: Anything else to say? (eat)

Urrley: If you asking me why I subscribed to Erivo for Burnable Bible is... Yes, I hate God. He disappointed me. I asked Him favour and the answer only runs in a time I am not wanted, Rest in Peace, my dream. Seondly, the social becomes too toxic. It's.. no longer what it used to be. Our church was cool, until... everyone's become bad guys. You don't want to hear how it's like there now.

Tommy: ..., You should be grateful, no family of yours ever died beside maybe because of age, or at least disease on old age. Btw, what's your dream you appalled it's failed?

Urrley: Pirates. I want to do business without being bound by trade rules of their world. Do whatever I want, except drugs if you ask. Weapons, Potions, Foods, Sex, anything. 

Tommy: And what really happened?

Urrley: My country made fatal blow to me. Since then, it's over. We must be disbanded before even my Piracy ever gets to conceive. Now my crews, families, had to take mundane jobs. I.. well.. got the sea but.. yeah. I asked God why. He only give me money. enough to feed up to 100 next gen & couple waste to luxury btw, I don't want that luxury. I just want to sell cool stuffs, that's all.

Tommy: Perhaps... you could've sold a contraband? A gun that's so simple could have a history that it ever been used to kill someone Based & Chad..

Urrley: Is that so? Well, if you say so... But the job of mine tho. I can't get out. That's the only way I live. Inflations everywhere. I am not enjoying my life!

Tommy: We can help you. But forgive me, we also under crisis but.., (give contact card)..

Urrley: (take & examine)

Tommy: DNB has new program to get you into the Rabbithole you want. The people right there are careful, and probably, the Pirates will have a commmand center that watch what's the object is like and how each has been, so you don't do Contraband.

Urrley: Ah... But wait. Isn't DNB Christian organization?

Tommy: Well it is, why wouldn't it?

Urrley: This gonna be difficult then.

Tommy: Don't worry, everyone of us including me will be monitored so nobody become .. bad guys, that's all. How else would you live in the new world, this Realm was bought from DNB afterall.

Urrley: Uh.. you're right..

Tommy: Now, anything else?

Urrley: I think that's the moment. Thank you.

Tommy: No problem! Don't hesitate to get in touch anytime!.

Urrley: (take out phone & explore DNB sauced within this card) I'll take a look at this.

Tommy: Well, if you excuse me. (leave)!....

Urrley: (the door!) Oh wait, (run to door)!.....! (Unchain), (open)!, Please.

Tommy: (nod thank you)!., (leave area & scene)

Urrley: ...... (close & rechain).!.

Tommy: No no, I'll portal, (open portal near the Church)!.. Guys! Reference kit!, (throw into portal)!, (close)!!, whew!.

Erivo: Okay. Good. Umm.. 

Tommy: Yes?

Erivo: A little.. chat?

Tommy: Sure.

Erivo: I don't talk these days. Feels the days have been over since long.

Tommy: Hmm.. You got something you do back then?

Erivo: I collect souls. And these souls explores an abstract place we call Monolith. The souls are all Trekkers. We've been adventuring so long, acquired new friends along the way, not only, Trekkers but also others. .. Wow. just 20 years of passing (since EOS of Stella Sora) feels like... eternity have passed.

Tommy: You're quite the adventurer. Now that you're talking, I'd like to ask. Ever you met another Tyrant?

Erivo: Yes. A couple, each with different souls. Until... The true purpose... and then, we all escape. long story.

Please edit above line if there is a reveal about Tyrants purpose in Stella Sora!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tommy: mmm. How about a Tyrant named Joel?

Erivo: Joel? Isn't he who is Kaorfa?

Tommy: Yeah. You met him?

Erivo: Ah snap, guess I missed that adventure, sorry about that. He's Tyrant too? I thought he's doing Protogen stuff from what I've heard.

Tommy: Well, Kaorfa did so many adventures, so of course he got to be mobile lots of times. I can understand that.

Erivo: I see.

Tommy: How's your friends been?

Erivo: Good. They have lifes now. I trust they're very busy these days. It's best to move on to a new stuff, I think. Beside, getting resource is waaaaay too cumbersome than some of other adventures. Gosh, just to fullfill 1 wish to a character I gotta spend 75% of my salary!! Geez, what a rip.

Stella Sora is greedy. Resource cost very expensive compared to other F2P games alike.

Tommy: Ah, I remember.

Erivo: So yeah, best it's gone. If it had to return, best it's not a rip like before.

Tommy: ... I believe there will be a new Rabbithole you can try to relive your nostalgia. Ever you heart about DNB Rabbithole program?

Erivo: I heard! But.. unfortunately, I couldn't find the Rabbithole exactly same as.. Stella Sora before.

Tommy: I'm pretty sure it eventually will be available. In the meantime, you can try other smaller ones.

Erivo: Cool. I'll check again.

.

.

.

.

Tommy: Is there anything else?

Erivo: Wait, there is one? Says here *we will help you fullfill your customer's wishes, until it's done and your customer yours*. .., 

Obtain Trekkers ala Duet Night Abyss

Erivo: Sounds like they'll help me to get em *for free*?, and.. Availability Guarantee... Okay. I think I must go.

Tommy: Then go! before they left again.

Erivo: Thanks for you help btw! If you excuse me, (hold the table), (run ability warp)!!

jeger! Erivo left the scene.
