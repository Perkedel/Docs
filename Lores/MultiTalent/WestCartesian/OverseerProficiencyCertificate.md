# Overseer Proficiency Certificate

The Overseer Proficiency Certificate is a license exam that assess your worth of bearing extra Overseer features. Every Overseer will start with whatever DNB provides. But there are other features which only those who are worthy of bearing such, because e.g., those feature are very sensitive and if abused, can cause fatal disaster. That is why every sometimes, DNB always provide a voluntary exam that grants you this certificate to unlock those extra features.  

Mind you, doing this exam may not be easy as being memorized of the answer.

## Begin

Tommy & Brothers has arrived at the Overseer plaza. They are now here to take on the commission. It was to take an Overseer Proficiency Exam, because the next level will require them to use the feature which requires that Proficiency License.

Characters:
- Tommy (Main)
- Manny
- Benny
- Lisa (to Tommy). can manipulate materials atomically
- Dana (to Manny)
- Gina (to Benny)

Korlap has been waiting. They noticed the brothers.

Korlap: Hey! Over here!

Tommy & brothers go to the shout source

Korlap: Tommy! and brothers, welcome! Welcome to the plaza. So, the Commission?

Tommy: uh yeah.. She (Lisa) told me to take this exam..

Korlap: Great! It's right here, on the classroom I'll bring you. Are you guys ready?

Tommy: Umm..

Korlap: Don't worry if you're nervous. The exam is very easy. All you have to do is.., answer honestly, that's it.

Tommy: Hmm..

Korlap: Come, follow me.

### Hallway

While walking towards the classroom

Korlap: May I ask you few questions? This survey is used for extra considerations by the DNB.

Tommy: Okay, sure. What is it?

Korlap: *Why are you interested to become an Overseer?*

Tommy: Well, ever since I was a kid, I wanted to explore world.

Manny: We thought the world was only so much of houses, neighbours, and the people. We are wrong.

Benny: There are vast. ...

Tommy: So.. yeah. We are very curious, what's been out there.

Korlap: Hmm... (checking next question)...., Interesting... Fascinating. It appears you guys immediately have answered all 3 at once.

Tommy: Oh really, we did?

Korlap: Yup, the next two were *What do you expect of becoming Overseer* which I can fill this as.. `Doing Adventures`, **Explore the world** you say, and the... *Will you explore more world that what you see, as being an Overseer?*. It's.. yeah, `Curiousity`. You wanted to try something new. That's the spirit.

Tommy: Oh wow. That's it? Huh.. May I know the story, behind all this? I thought it should be... be brave, and try new things, DNB provides!..

Korlap: Well you see, firstly Overseer indeed is to try something new. And as... things expand, there are now things we discover... could be risky. *Experimental Features* for short.

Tommy: Ah..

Korlap: That is why, for those kinds of risky things, only those who are worthy shall be allowed to use such features. It's not easy you know. One slip and that world doomed. But... So far, The features specific to the Overseer were just..-that. No lethal, I'll tell you guys if there is. For now, you'll have some only.

Tommy: Isn't this very tedious? I believe license should be streamlined as maybe.. our life at school goes? with catch ups?

Korlap: Good question!... Yeah, there's problem. We did, originally planned to make this a part of POC License but... After reanalyzing, the Overseer Proficiency part is... already a story of it's own. Man, not gonna lie, KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) is bullshit & full of nonsense. But perhaps... had we joined them... that only complexifies things, when we say.. just wanted to communicate. And the same time, use the.. Extra hands... when we are too nervous to.. Roger-roger idk what the hell.

Tommy: Hmmm... There's a point...

Korlap: Okay!. Here we are, this room.

This classroom has been assigned for the Overseer Proficiency Certificate exam. It's just a voluntary quick exam taking. There are computers each desk, where you fill in the exam.

Korlap: DOne?

Tommy: Screw it, man. This roadblock stops me here.

Korlap: Hey!.., Don't faith it man. You did it well. Now, follow me, it's time to take a break. The result should be here in a minute.

### Canteen

Korlap bought the brothers the lunch. Unfortunately it's the regular rice. Tommy & brothers eat it anway like it's the monday after past the sunday tonight.

Korlap: Okay. How's the rice?

Tommy: Meh, it's nothing. Though you got the vegetables and sosigs.

Korlap: We call this Lazy Rice, a.k.a. Nasi Mager. Like the name says, this is a lazily prepped rice, but desperately wanted to have a taste, so enough, you don't need to have separate condiments. Just gobble up, and resume job.

Tommy: ... Is this one of your experiment?

Korlap: Of course! At DNB we always innovates! This one, is for the Mager series. We are very lazy, but can't leave things too bland even though it's too routine, so? yeah. Btw, this is the default food conceived from our Posko Gaming Research Center right here. The employee felt the rice is way to bland. I mean.. duh, but they felt their time is wasted too much to select different condiments just for it. So, Leafa, the chef there, mixed the vegetables bits & few sosigs along with the Rice Cooking. Take it out, and sprinkle some salt. She recommends Mountain Crystal (in earth is Himalayan Salt), but any salt that give salt, should works. Mix it up, and serve, that's it.

Tommy: Huh..

Korlap: Don't worry, uh.. we have the recipe.. on the Git somewhere, you.. I'll PM you that. Speaking of, you should see notification, I believe it's past 30 minutes, and your score should been released now. 

Tommy & brothers began to check

Korlap: Come, check it out. How is it going?

The email has arrived. All 3 have passed and received the digital license on their DNB user account.

Tommy: Huh, we did it. What next?

Korlap: Congratulations! Alright, follow me. Next session, Character Cartridge.

Tommy: Hmm?

### another classroom.

The classroom used is desolate. Only the teacher & the brothers here.

Korlap: Wow. What a difference. looks like it's just us now.., (check session data).... (the lecturer is Korlap himself) Oh!.. It's my turn!, be here.. Heh... God's plan (*not a coincidence*). 

Tommy: Shall we begin?

Korlap: Well.. the extra feature we got right now is (offer the cartridge) this.

Tommy & brothers pondered

Korlap: Character Cartridge. This system is used to spawn extra hands temporarily, e.g., you have a commission, and out of hand, and all your friends were busy. (lift), with this, (use)!!, You can do it now.

There are *two* Korlaps

Tommy: (intrigued expression) Huh...

Korlap: (reset)!, Go ahead, (offer to the brothers) try one, 

Tommy & brother take each one

Korlap: it's simple, just think to spawn it, when holding your desired cartridge.

Please Adjust your Tactical Backpack! Open Pause menu, Arsenal, category backpack. You have received a free Character & Weapon. First, install the weapons to the Cartridge. Then drag the prepped Cartridge into onto one of the slot of the Backpack circle.

To activate the cartridge, Return to Gameplay. Open Backpack by holding L2 and Push Right Analog Stick towards where did you put the cartridge at which slot.

Tommy: Like this (activate)?

Now Tommy spawned Korlap.

Korlap: Great job!

Manny & Benny also spawned their Korlaps.

Korlap: You guys too! See? Easy right?

Tommy: (then what's so dangerous about it) 🤨🤨???, (deactivate)!- (oh yeah, there's one) 🤔🤔🤔...

Korlap: So, Any question?

Tommy: I trust... there's a risk, in which a reason you guys put this behind.. the license requirement..

Korlap: Very perceptive. Indeed. Uh.. you see.. Cartridge of Character gets you full on the body. It's hologram, can react, feel pain, die... if die can be recharged either using an electric power or just let it sit by air, or sun... you can have it back.. And also.. (the sus) yeah. You should know that.

Tommy: Of course.. Formidable..

Korlap: Well, after all, you'll get your starter cartridge, DNB gives these away for you, and if you happen to be reckless, **that's on you**, can't stress this further. Also, you can get more by doing more adventures and fighting more boss. Making empty cartridge is easy as buying DIY electronic assemble kit. Just upload whatever you feel about the Character, onto the cartridge. Easy as that. Full book will also be provided.

Tommy: Got it. yeah.

Qiurne: (PTT) Roger roger, Korlap, you're needed at the Touch Grass Lab, ASAP, Qiurne, over. (release)!

Korlap: (take HT) Oagh, is it Gampis again?, (PTT) Roger, Korlap. Acknowledge, on my way over (release)!.. Sorry guys, looks like I have to handle exploded students again. Class dismissed, (open portal) if you have followup questions, just make a ticket, see ya, (enter), (close)!!

Tommy: ... Well guys... that's just one. Guess this is what can we use now.

**LEVEL COMPLETE**

## Extra

The Character spawned only has virtual conciousness based on yours and won't have own.

## Bonus: Character Cartridge of Enemies

If you acquired any Character Cartridge that is an Enemy / Boss, you will unlock this quest.

A man then appears standing inside, by the Overseer plaza longue door lip. **Talk to him** to start the bonus quest.

Korlap: Hey hey, Tommy. How you been?

Tommy: Good. I was just wandering. See if anyone here would issue commission somewhere.

Korlap: Ah..

Tommy: Been good. (ponder upon an Enemy Character Cartridge) Made fortune recently.

Tommy has the Character Cartridge based on the boss fight he did.

Korlap: (noticed that even more formidable Character Cartridge)?? Where's your brothers?

Tommy: Oh, they're busy right now. Ever since I've moved in.. things got hectic here. We gotta arrange stuffs here and out. Wow.

Korlap: Congratulations on your new home.. and new nation

Tommy: Thanks. I'm afraid I may not be able to adventure anymore, but thanks for the butlers you gave us.

Korlap: Nah, it's nothing. I'm glad you satisfied, and at DNB we help.

Tommy: Ahm....

Korlap: Aand what you got there? Seems powerful..

Tommy: Oh this? Tralve. Our traitor I stumbled upon.

Tralve is the insane boss

Tommy: Took a while for the first time, but I've studied alot. Learning how she attack, what skill and when she uses it, etc. Feels like a spar now as I've came back stronger.

Korlap: (yep, that's too dangerous holding on Tralve cartridge like that, time to warn) Haha.... ... ... ... I got some tips for you. I trust you hate to miss this.

Tommy: Oh really? I'd like to!

Korlap: (unlean & haste walk) Come, follow me.

Tommy: (follow) Coming..

### Korlap's office

Korlap: (telepathy turn on lamp)!, Alright, (offer point to treasury room behind desk) this way.

Tommy: (showing treasure) whoaow!....

Korlap: Wait, dont' get too excited. We're not here to show some of my gold. This is very important and serious.

Tommy: Huh, what's the tense now?

Korlap: (open chest full of returned Enemy Cartridges)

This chest is full of copies of Erentia. Erentia is the most dangerous boss woman. She has since been arrested for her fatal crimes. She tormented thousands of Overseer and full of herself.

Korlap: The... Problematic.

Tommy: (curious)...., (take one & examine)...

As Tommy lifted up the Cartridge, whole devastating memories floods down towards Tommy's brain. Memories of her traumatizing actions and extortions here and there.

Tommy: (drop shocked) HH!!

Korlap: Oh shit. Maybe we shouldn't have touched it.

Tommy: What... the... hell... `Blocked`.. `Blocklist`.. `Mass blocklist`.... `acuse` heuh...

Korlap: (close the chest)!!, (lock)! (push Tommy to rest on a luxury chair there)!.. Let's not talk about it. That Cartridge replicates... but herself.

Tommy: She's good.. but alas (she is toxic person)..

Korlap: No matter what.. Bill of Anonymity signed or not, she is beyond saving. The Overseers tried to reuse her either to help others or themselves or both. We only expect **the callout for *abusing* her intellect, when the others found out**. Well not just that, **her toxicity contaminates our brain, it corrupts also**. Best to move on. AI wins. Only way to restore been what placeheld by AI is... rebuild. Port her style, and/or.... have similar type, and equal or better power. Wait that's for battle, for other stuffs... Unfortunately, that's beyond what DNB can answer atm.

Tommy: This...

Korlap: So that's the tip I'd wanna share today. If you had to use Enemies, use it wisely, and carefully, especially if there was an insensitive incident behind this. If you had to be, where one is this.. then.. again, rebuild it as similar as possible. I'm sorry, to drag you to this mess. I'm afraid you'll be

Tommy: No it's okay. I'll take this. I knew it. I should be more careful to what I'd do with these.

Tommy got more Enemy based Character Cartridge.

Korlap: Ueah... Be careful with those. We are free for consultation if you unsure.

Tommy: Okay.. I think.. I need rest.

Korlap: Oh, would you like

Tommy: No need. (open portal)!, (enter), (close)!
