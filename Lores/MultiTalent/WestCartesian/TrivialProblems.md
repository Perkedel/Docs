# Trivial Problems

Excerpt

## Begin

Nolis has successfully led the Young Adults program. These fresh graduates are hired right ahead, to run serveral Rabbit Holes of various kinds, and be paid for it.

Characters:
- Tommy (Main)
- Manny
- Benny

Nolis: Class!, The Warriors have arrived. No-need-greeting-this-time.., I just wanna have a chat. Okay, you guys, simple. Just hold this (demonstrate) rod like this, (handover)

Tommy take and keep the transform of the back cabled rod

Nolis: Yes, keep it.., until the screen says `100%`.

.

.

Nolis: Okay, good.. take it easy..

Success

Nolis: Good!, now put the rod back to its vase.

Tommy insert the rod back to its case. Still, this abstract machine seems very hard to understand what impetus of this doohickey is.

Tommy: Okay.

Nolis: That's it. Done for today.

Tommy: Wait?, That's it?

Nolis: Yup. Well.. We are now on beta testing phase. All you do here is to try these Rabbit Holes across this room. At your pace, go fiddle around and discuss around it this place.

Tommy: Beta Testing? That's on me too!

Nolis: That makes it perfect for my phase. You're going to run this contract you've just accepted for the next 2 weeks. Pick what you interested most, and if you happen to stuck on just a few or one Rabbit Hole, it's okay, that's normal. That's the purpose. As the part of the Rabbit Hole Fork program here in DNB, When this public, We want to invite new beings across realms to bring new Rabbit Hole experience. More is better I guess. As I'm waiting for this (offer) proposal to be approved,

Tommy take & read few details at glance. It's the proposal to make this sub-program public & another pages, which are license proposal of hiree as `traveler`.

Nolis: We're going to test, if the supposed travelers would take whatever they see interested in, take part into the Hole, and then be dedicated to it. I'm tired of this bullshit. Everyone deserves the Experience. I am not going to see the entitlement shits, EVER again. I hope YOu understand.

Tommy: Well.. there's alot of things here.

a Young Adult is doing the Arenod Made Up Heart doohickey. They're using it as a twin pump for their welder machine. The heart is set to beat at 1000 BPM. Its right side leads the blood to pickup abundant oxygen, then back again to left side, for it to carry oxygen to the heating nozzle osmosisly. Other Young Adults are taking notes of this abstract doohickey and analyzing this novel impetus of it this.

Nolis: Of course! More is better! And more subs in a Hole is EVEN better. Don't you think.

Tommy: ... May I ask. Where were you before this?

Nolis: Well I was just... an office man. Well, not in here. t'was in Perkedel.

Tommy: Wait. As Viorfa?

Nolis: No no, Notary. Papers. Until... Uh.. long short, We were the best. We were just starting up. It took really a while. Kaorfa was just dealing for other business that's all I know. Next minute, he went to shock. I began to notice few papers that says.. basically, an episode that... you already know, **the whole office crumbles**. We have to stop. We must go home. Leave him alone, forever. Refuse to know his where about, I hope he still alive this 2045 above. Who knows. Yeah.

Tommy: Let me... tell you this. You said the same story has the Wanderer few months ago said.

Nolis: Wait, Wanderer? You mean.., Wanderer Lurge?

Tommy: Yes, ... him.

Nolis: Wow...., Lurge's usually never share anything to anybody. Especially about his past and the past before that. Unless.... .. I'm glad he's lucky. Have me you. I only know the last time check before total disconnection the second year after the crumbling that... he's running out of money. Worse that was his job at Crossban at his home. Which indicates a corruption going on with the government. Forgor what was that, says to be licensed must profit the senators boys or what idk. Complex, but this pattern here, we all experienced it all the tIme. Idk how did he met you but... Thank you.

Tommy: He's in my home btw. You wanna meet him? I can appoint this for next day..

Nolis: Oah, Thank you so much. Yeah.., he was my best friend. We are officemate, very close. We had to part ways due to this incident. Idk.. how do I say thank you?

Tommy: Nah man, it's my duty.

Nolis: No no, perhaps I have an exclusive item you can take here as a bonus. Well, let's think for that later. Thank you. Haah..., Therefore you see.... ueh.., things we experience was.... small - yet.. very devastating. I can't fathom what's next it would be.

Tommy: Don't give up by then. If it comes again, We will together hold it together.

Nolis: Ahaha.. that's right. Hold it together. Of course. Though I always briefed this all the time, felt always seldom to neverary.

Tommy: No problem man. Okay. Let's see... Ah,

There is RPG Rabbit Hole going on there.

Tommy: RPG, my favourites.

Sutol: This is the simulation sir. It's a server based simulation, though the server is here. We actually travels IRL.

Tommy: Oh? You travels physically too?

Sutol: Of course!

Tommy: Wow guys, got more friend! (greet) Name's Tommy. This is, Manny & Benny. We're brothers.

Sutol: Oh brothers. Cool! (greet) Sutol.

Manny & Benney greeted therefore.

Tommy: Nice to meet ya. (drop) So uhm.. you travels physically. Do you also travel remotely?

Sutol: Yes, we do too. If.. e.g., we can't put our physical body onto the space we'd like to travel too, (minimized the simulation), we can always use various type, (open TigerVNC) Robots, digital files, etc.

Tommy: Ah yes.. That gonna be interesting. I usually travels physically. Ever since the great meteor migration.., we felt minus here. No place could we viably visit, coz each travels goes only for expansion of my house. If I want to visit far, that's costly, coz we're now moving realm.

Sutol: Don't worry brothers. I am the son of the rich merchant. My dad, Dorim, I'll meet you him later. We sometime gets commission of various kind. We got fuels and supplies, and this computer too. This is a gaming PC, with advanced Processed Network Card. We can travel anywhere to any type.

Tommy: Alright, seems I've just acquired a new friend. Our travel next time gonna be interesting.

Sutol: We guarantee that!.
