Punishment for the traitors

## Reminder

- The inmates prisoned into fakeworld vr
- the inmates likes it even tho realizes this is fake world. Interesting, but just in case let's turn on will disabler.
- you know what? fuck it, turn off. I am not an asshole. Let them really realize themselves. See if that would do it.
- I'm back! it's been 12 months in real world, therefore about 99999 eons there, and they still enjoyed the fake world wtf?! I think I should turn it off, but it's useless, their brain has been melted and at this point they're brain dead because their own fault, VR prison shall not be used too long bruh.
- Ugh, I turned it off, because it'd be waste of electricity. And yep, they're still sleeping, tiny brain activity, only on vital organs. What have we done?! idk, but they've done the most terrible thing noone think they would deserve any apology whatsoever..
