# Who was Nifle

## Begin

### Arenod Sediron Customer Center

Computer: Nomor Antrian: C, 84, Di kounter: 12

It's Parim's turn now! go to desk 12.

Parim stand up & go to desk 12 and sit onto the chair.

Gerfosh: Welcome to Arenod Sediron DNB Service Center, how may I help you?

Parim Pandora: I'd like to inquire an intel involving.., Lady Nifle, from Universe `Duet Night Abyss`.

Gerfosh: Alright, which one is it sir?

Parim: The reason to stay alive. (request mind reader) Context on my head.

Gerfosh: (acknowledge, take brain reader) I see.. . May I?

Parim: Sure.

Gerfosh: (handover to Parim) Excuse me, 

Parim: (accept & put on the brain scanner)

Gerfosh: Please keep this unit on your head for few seconds, (start scan)..

Reading context

Understood. Job compiling intel about this is has been started. 30 minutes approx to finish.

Gerfosh: Okay sir.., We have received your context.

The Customer Service system sent new follow-up ticket to Parim. This goes to a private meeting room.

Gerfish: Thank you for using our service, your follow up ticket has been sent to your phone, so please follow the direction shown on the ticket. 🙏 Great luck & God Bless you...

Parim stand up, open SMS. There's this ticket now. Press the URL to appear the hologram pathways.

The holographic blue line leading to the private meeting room next floor appears. Follow.

**Jump cut.**

Parim is awaiting at this appointed meeting room door which is closed. It's the fifth room on this floor 2.

Murj: (open door & lean head to opening), Mr. Parim? (saw) Oh, there you are. The documents are ready. Come in!..

### Private Meeting Room 205

It's a hologram meeting table. The table has an OLED screen on the surface.

Murj: Alright sir, (place Memory Box).., (swipe pull the virtual pull tab to mount the Memory Box disk)!, Here's your document.., (prepare to leave) Have a look and.. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to re-ask me again, by (offer point) press this chat & call button. Thank you.. (go to door)...., (open door), (out) and excuse me.. (politely close door).

Parim stop looking Murj, go look at these *scattered papers*. Begin scouring the intel you need.

.

Parim read the Ripples of Talk logs. JOELwindows7 (Phoxhunter) was there, eyes to eyes with Lady Nifle. And that's right, the intel said by Lady Nifle over there indeed corroborates with the letter left by Nyeol. But this is of course a fictional right? Because said so, Lady Niffle comes from another timeline. Keep looking.

.

This looks very real. Found footage. Nifle's parents were executed because of the wizardries of her parents. No more carefree Nifle, all gone, destroyed, Full Blown Trauma. Despite is not the same event, All in all, this pattern is the exact same political drama that come out from nowhere just like here with Perkedel Cinematic Universe, therefore Joel's life hence. How coincidental, This is what Parim's also been through. Keep looking. How the fuck..

.

Contemplate. Parim kept being reminded over & over of this. He is sure other fellow Axis Cartesian owners are have it this too. And again, found intel that follows, that Nifle says this is **to be faced again, but not a reason to redrown yourself to it**.

.

End of Scour. This is very inconclusive. This also leads to the same result. You can't bring back what you've lost. Whatever it is.

Parim: (extremely disappointed)..... (distrust if afterall this is just a coincidence fabricated just for him) Ugh.... Who.., are you? ........ Are you real?, or perhaps, another fabrication, drawn by man.., or worse, a machine?..

Thankfully no, Duet Night Abyss presumably was Written by humans.

Parim: ... I'm not buying this. Nu uh. You're from a different universe. And since I failed to find more who had been the same with me, I must die. For real this time. ...... (but then, about the go to hell)....., (contemplate the left forearm)...

It's full of needle holes. Though due to his immortality cures, those young cells are there in each circle like bunch of craters made by meteorites.

Parim: (contemplate deep)..., but if you say.... ***I'm teleported to hell who knows... for rejecting my.... power.....*** (decide to cease self-poisoning) then so be it. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Ugh... will DNB weirded out if I request a trip to another universe.... This place looks dangerous. But I got to see her (Nifle).

### Flashback to 1 minute before Bus Boys' arrival

Devet: Argh shit.., I'm so careless..

Actually, it's this newbie. He instantly disintegrated after slipping up the poison vials just before Parim's experimental bed, and splashed them to himself.

Devet: Dammn! If only there could be a way noone had to see this..

Lug: (saw the source of glass break, continue) Hey what's going on there?

Devet: Don't come close! Poison! uh.. we spilled it. We apologize.

Tort: (arrive to Devet) Yes?

Devet: (point to newbie) Resurrector!, Just.. stay back, I'll clean this up., (take out nozzle from his backpack vacuum cleaner), Far away please... The same.. Pufferfish venom...

Lug: Heugh... (then sad depressed again for his son) ugh...

The scene has been cleaned up that sparkling. Somehow.

Completed delivery, minus one. But don't worry, Parim doesn't care. The poison must go.

Tort resurrected the newbie

Devet: It's done. uh.. Sorry, lose one. Ugh.. dang...

Lug: I don't want Parim keep doing this. I believe I must call Arenod Sediron for another one.

Devet: NO!! Please do not!! I was the client for a war 3 years back! I didn't know poison warfare is illegal, so much so they hunt down the company that helped the war boss about it. Pleees... NO..

Lug: HUh?... Oh... Okay. I am not interested dealing with your complicated background. There's guests about to arrive btw, so better leave now, they're DNB coz my son needs help.

Devet: ARGH FUCK!!! (deperate check everything else) Uhh.. uhmm..... I think it's done, (rush back to car)!!!!!, is Curse okay?!

Tort: He's recovering. 80 BPM.

Devet: Thank God.., See ya!

Portal from bottom and swipe height! The Poisoners have left the scene.

Lug: Hugh.......

The Bus Boys Arrives 5 second later.

Lug: Oh shit.

and the awkward greeting goes.

### End flashback. Poison Factory

Devet: Wait.. you mean client stop poisoning self?!??!

Hatre: For now.. We still must keep sending what's left to the client.

Devet: But no.. did we made agreement not to stash any poison ever more? DNB's gonna eventually find out!

Hatre: Let me remember, (telepathy to phone implant and search the Parim's document)..., Well we did not set an agreement other than that the poison is received anyway. Had I state `must be used` that's idiot. I am the responsible. Aii hope.. that's not gonna be considered with **just send** that's it.. 

Devet: .... Boss, if DNB find about this, we're all doomed!. There's still 96 crates left. We gotta find a new client that promises not to poison anyone here! Seriously, is the disposal ready now?

Hatre: Still no, I'm afraid. Yesterday DNB has been checking our disposal and scoured our logs. At least they didn't figured out the fabricated ones. But it will gone also. Account logs next month no longer allow data redaction, especially dangerous endeavour like this one.

Devet: Ouuuuaaaaaaaaaaaa**aaaaaaaa..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**, no.................

.

.

HT rings

Devet: (surprised shock) HOAA!!, Phone (reach the HT and see who's calling)...,

It's DNB. Heavy thunk. Devet froze petrification

Hatre: (from Devet's shock that mean it's the government) Answer it. After all as business actors, ones must answer to the government.

Devet: (unpetrify temporarily) Okay..., (lift).., (Press) Yess, Poisoners.. may I help you? (release).

Teddy Sediron: (ptt) On behalf of your client, I request your poisons. All of them. (rel)

Devet: (ptt) All? .. wait, what client? We got a lot!. (nervous) hehe.. .. (rel)

Teddy: (ptt) Parim. Do you know him. (rel)

Devet: (shocked, how tf DNB know?!) Oh shit.. ..

Hatre: (not good, they found out!)??, (walk to Devet) give me that.

Devet: (offer give scaredly)!, 

Hatre: (take), (ptt) How do you want to do this, and what do you want?!.

Teddy: Chill, like we gonna arrest you coz you're the commissioner of war Loathe Head.

Heavy thunk. Yep, we're all doomed. DNB always knows.

Hatre: ... (ptt) If you dare, take your steps in for attempted arrest, I'm sorry but we forcedly have to explode this entire place (with poison flooding). Don't worry about me, and all my employees, only you

Devet: (async) (whisper from distance) (scared wave rejection) NO! PLS NO! DO NOT KILL THE BROTHER OF THE KING SEDIRON!! DO NOT!!

Hatre: gonna get it. Beside!, This all new rule was made last minute just before we act on the war after the Loathes accidentally thought about poisoning way too hard you guys overheard it. telepathically, you stalkers.. (rel)!

Teddy: (ptt) Ugh.. fine, I know you upset, but please, we can cleanse the poisons into anti-venoms. No arrest shall be made, (open portal onto the office portal), (end call)

Devet: HOAH!!!

Hatre: (also internal panik)?!?!

Teddy: you just come here. C'mon.

Devet: Uh...

.

.

Jeally Iray: Hey, c'mon, be quick! I have login by 3 AM in a minute!

Hatre: (Jeally is on the DNB's side, he's arrested then) Jeally??, Oh shit (time to surrender), (take the remote control & necklace its strap)!.., (prepare bring the trolley carrying the poisons to the portal) C'mon, Deve, we're done here. Just bring everything to duke Sediron.

Devet: Okay.., (get into aligning carriages from tail)!..

**transition scene**

The workers here now have been converting the poisons into the anti-venom.

Devet: Ugh.. this is awkward. What the fuck did we do here? We didn't see the rule has come of course because of a.. stalkingly leaked coincidence. I hate to be curious. What's going on with our client here? He stopped, and then you showed up on behalf of.. Mr. Parim, You always like peeping businesses, I mean.. government duty.., but..

Teddy: You guys don't have to worry. Parim explicitly asked us to not torture you. I have confirmed your truth, there was an accidental leak we overheard. And I apologize on behalf of the government of DNB, but duty is a duty. We are ordered to act on every overhears we caught.

Devet: (client told the DNB? Traitor?) Idk what to say anymore, we are not interested with client's background. (Although, in case if the DNB would always brutally arrest, then Parim wouldn't call DNB in the first place then?) But.. ... Parim wouldn't leak this info, if you would kill us all?..

Teddy: Don't worry. There is always a better way. Also I trust this is very important to you to hear. Your client has been asking your poison, to inject those all to himself. He was traumatized. Like many other Axis Cartesians, Parim was banned from his own community, for his righteous callouts. He lost everything. Feels worthless. His dad panicking, luckily an ambulance happens to pass right at hid dad's former workshop, only then has to die because brain asphyxiation over 10 minutes.

Devet: Huh? brain.. he hung himself?

Teddy: Spot on!.., Crossban Vacation Island of the former planet sent us report. We (Division Resurrector) rushed in, There's his graveyard. We happen to have an experimental update we're working on. The feature was to make one no longer die-able. Oh it works. Idk how. Suiciders shouldn't be resurrectable. That mean.., God still had mission for him in this world. Don't know what, but shall be found out eventually.

Devet: Um okay?

Teddy: And now.., you suddenly receive a contract agreement to send the poisons to him.

Devet: Yes, that's correct. HUH?? I mean.. I can only think it's supposed to be for experiment idk what. We also did require before it's signed to not go and poison anyone. We put stringent rules. Thankfully no records rise by Mr. Parim. We're good!.. hah.. haha... heum..

Teddy: And now he stopped. I still couldn't understand honestly, just by looking at Nifle's story. Or perhaps..., other factors, Ah.. [It's Nyeol's file](/Lores/MultiTalent/NorthCartesian/WhoWasNifle.md). Likely. hmm..

Devet: Wow.. that's deep if I honest be.

Teddy: There has been many and so severe case of dramas going on here. I only able to wish after we established Arenod Sediron couple decades ago things should be over. Nah nope, that's a reckless behaviour. We got still other things both outside Arenod Sediron & in. Only after Jesus strikes back it will.. will.

Devet: ...

Hatre: Duke Sediron, So, you wanted to give the antidotes to the victims?

Teddy: Spot onn!\~.., I know this is kinda awkward. But we always have to try.

Hatre: Yeah I mean.., I read alot from the Controls. They're notorious. That's why we didn't hesitate to support Loathes. Not because of family despite is.., we have believe.. same like you, creative must flow free, can't be shackled by... obnoxious rules (like absurd house rules). Considering their behaviour lately, yes, it's awkward. 99.99% likely they won't accept to apologize (did you mean `forgive`) us for it. We have poisoned them, we're responsible. They even have learnt how to Heresy of Manipulate!

the Loathes & their friend, Poisoners are known to have bad grammars.

Teddy: Our duty then is to protect citizens from being further harrassed by hoaxful accusations. Reconcile or not, you have accepted the way of redemption, the only way we could provide to you.

Hatre: Uh.. thanks?

Teddy: You're welcome.
