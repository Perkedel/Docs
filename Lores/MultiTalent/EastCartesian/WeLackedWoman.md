Oscar: Oh... Then it's must be a mistake too confidential to reveal, Okeh, won't pry further.

Oscar knew it's for AI sampling, but it's paid every file approved, but he does not grudge anyway.

Enter the menu!

Here's the recording booth menu. Simple!

- Start by pressing `+` on bottom right to create new voice model.
- Write its identity! The `Name`, `Description`, `License`, & other fields. It's important to credit all sauces into the `Sauces` table if you involved other sources.
- `Create`
- Now you entered the model edit menu. Begin filling in the samples. `Start Record All` to start filling process. You'll fill these one by one
  - `Aa`
  - `Ee`
  - `Oo`
  - `Ae`
  - `Oh`
  - `Tha`
  - `Da`
  - `Ta`
  - `Ra`
  - `La`
  - Plus your extra phonemes if you want. More is better, or sometimes detriment.
- Once you've filled important sample, it'll save automatically. You can preview your recording.
- If you sure, then Submit to set privacy to `Public`. Your model will be usable by everyone yay!
  - It is also recommended to license it at worstly: `CC4.0-BY-SA` (Yes Reupload (?), Must Credit, Remix Must same license) & under. **Be careful!** If you chose with any constrictive restriction, your model will be ignored and *thrown away* by the community (regardless of use (commercial or not) & context)!

## Begin

Wallace the Mayor has arrived. Today's speech is about the lack of actual woman that did insane but useful stuffs for the people.

<!--
Presentation of lack of woman. Characters in almost MultiTalent game we got here currently consists of many males, but few females. That's not alright! Joel! you also goon, so pls add more female! And that's exactly the problem! We lack real female VA! As the result, we lacked woman characters and turned this whole MultiTalent game to Otome, or worse, gay game?? NAh, too far, just Otome, hopefully, you got the idea.

But sir, isn't some games like Blue Archive & Trickal Revival (Chibi Go) exclusively female characters that'd drive normal women away? Why are we probleming this now over here?

Wait! don't yeet! He got point! That's the thing! There is no balance! Argh, idc. But yeah, Otome games are niche! Our goal is to originally make it female like every other!

THat's Red ocean sir! Otome is niche, and low profit, and it's new. Beside we already at least have few female!

Okey yeet him

noooo!!! Just so you know, Joel's young sister also played ZZZ & other hoyo games and picked Male more than female for that reason!!!!!!!!! YOu cannot do this to me!!!!!!

So guys! we must add female to strike the scale back to our goal!

.
.

You're just a VA voicing the successful crazy characters.

You're only doing VA, without the actual success of the Character you sampled for.

No I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the manufacturer of your Larynx! (stab vein-probely)!!

Dude what the hell am i thinking. idk any of this shit!
