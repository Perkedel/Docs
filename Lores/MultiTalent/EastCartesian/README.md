# East Cartesian

The 5 scammed. These people have been hospitalized in an institution after the Balthezer's scam. Barthesel? 
At first, the Balthezer offers healthies, and 5 took part voluntarily. All they have to deposit is random part of their body.  
It's given, and now they're healthy. bla bla bla do something.  
Then, after Balthezer defeat in Arenod Sediron, he go back home. and his home dimension is locked prisonedly by Arenod Sediron.  
He lost, all his descendant can only walk around Balthezer. Balthezer suicides, explodos like Kamatussa. The dimension explodes with him & descendants.  
And so, not only all Balthezer sourced body disintegrates (Mindy Halim disintegrate) that also follow here with the 5. Now each have void in their body at the part Balthezer chose.

Arenod Sediron did cured them, and they got all parts back like nothing happened. However, considering Balthezer action, anyone ever got involved are considered heretic hence subject to discrimations.  
Arenod Sediron then helped them find new lives as best they could. Alas, nothing ever works, and ultimately Arenod Sediron handover their old experiment of Lively Realm without people at East Middle Cartesian.  
The East Middle Cartesian was an effort to make house with a vibe of Family Guy Quahog, as full detail, but intentionally left unlived, even the tiniest bacteria are never found. It works, the condition is still pristine.  
Now given to the 5, and all the starter supplies are given. This, is their new life.
