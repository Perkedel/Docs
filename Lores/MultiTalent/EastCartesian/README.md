# Chronicles (East Cartesian)

The 5 scammed. These people have been hospitalized in an institution after the Balthezer's scam. Barthesel? 
At first, the Balthezer offers healthies, and 5 took part voluntarily. All they have to deposit is random part of their body.  
It's given, and now they're healthy. bla bla bla do something.  
Then, after Balthezer defeat in Arenod Sediron, he go back home. and his home dimension is locked prisonedly by Arenod Sediron.  
He lost, all his descendant can only walk around Balthezer. Balthezer suicides, explodos like Kamatussa. The dimension explodes with him & descendants.  
And so, not only all Balthezer sourced body disintegrates (Mindy Halim disintegrate) that also follow here with the 5. Now each have void in their body at the part Balthezer chose.

Arenod Sediron did cured them, and they got all parts back like nothing happened. However, considering Balthezer action, anyone ever got involved are considered heretic hence subject to discrimations.  
Arenod Sediron then helped them find new lives as best they could. Alas, nothing ever works, and ultimately Arenod Sediron handover their old experiment of Lively Realm without people at East Middle Cartesian.  
The East Middle Cartesian was an effort to make house with a vibe of Family Guy Quahog, as full detail, but intentionally left unlived, even the tiniest bacteria are never found. It works, the condition is still pristine.  
Now given to the 5, and all the starter supplies are given. This, is their new life.

At some point in time, Now that these 5 founders successfully continued such new lives, People come, out, and circle around here. Events includes marriages & breedings. This once again diversifies total DNA compositions here in East Cartesian, just like Duron Sediron wanted in his Arenod-Sediron's Total Goal.

Which eventually, created one prominent family. For context, the East Cartesian scenery, established in an Empty Intentionale Experiment from long ago, looks like one of those adult cartoons. Namely: Family Guy, American Dad, Simpsons, Oggy, and alike. The grade of colors, vibes, air, and such, inspired DNB to create their own, and of course Open Source. With no time, Viorfa approved, so does the Chronicles. All interesting moments will be recorded, compiled, and be viewed by thousands across realms.

The `Family Guy Moment`. Will unite cutaways of various kind, may include offensive ones, just like Family Guy is. Skits comes at all time, complete with whackiness like Family Guy. Though inspired spirit, `Chronicles` was not meant to compete Family Guy & alike. In fact, quite the contrary. Since Family Guy EOS decades ago, and who knows the reboot might be succ if there is, `Chronicles` serves as a place to tell whacky stories, for the minds who shall understand and able to respond well.

Do not underestimate the animation style! Chronicles uses semi-realistic animation framings. in this CGI, it's all Three Dimensional. Again, not to diss the former source of inspiration, like Family Guy (2D simple draw) & alike. Regarding of repeat and variants, we will of course use that. Thanks to meme animation templating, episodes can reuse the mega-pose animation that's meme'd across realms, such as `NO no no nononono!!! 🛁💥`.
