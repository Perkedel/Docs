# South Middle Cartesian

is FNAF but not about animatronic. Nor somebody becomes victim. It's about being a villain.

[Start The first flashback and the reason to find out why](TheVillainy.md)

It's like FNAF because you view the CCTVs. But like the sequels, not only you can interact something, but also you get to control the weapons to activate traps that intrude your lairs.

Instead of Jumpscare and then Game over, heroes that managed to reach your office will face you. Now, you'll fight vs. them. Win this fight to continue looking at CCTV.

Keep ensuring your lair secure until time runs out, just like FNAF 6 AM.

You can upgrade your traps to strengthen their powers. Upgrade yourself and your defense weapons to help ease your fight when heroes reaches your office.
