Scene of Parim failed CPR because brain too damaged, exceeded 10 minutes alarm late. People assembled scene looking at 2 doctors saddened.

Lug Pandora: **NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOO HOO HOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Jump cut to resurrected Parim beam

And jump transition to the leaving

Lug & Nut is facing each other, as Lug is bidding farewell to the rest of the team. Pandora family must leave this realm to his North Cartesian promptly to remote themselves and hopefully find self recoveries. This workshop therefore handed over to Nut.

Silence in the workshop. The Ark ship is standing by for Pandora

.

.

.

.

Lug: This is... terrible.

Nut: It's okay. We will continue to serve for the people, until we can't, idk for when.

Lug: Just... remember the lesson I told you. You have the friend that you need. They are all always here for you.

Nut: ... What about you? Will you find new yours?

Lug: Ah.. don't worry, I'll see, just.. worry about yourself. That's all I want.

Nut: .... It's heavy to farewell so sudden when we have been so peaked. How long was it?

Lug: 35 years? ... damn, if we think about this, it still feel short. But yeah.. world..

Nut: I'm gonna miss you alot. You're my guide. Had you not come to me to catch me before I *fell of the ledge*... idk what I'd become?

Lug: Pls.. don't be villain. I know the world is evil. But you cannot kill people and then loot everything because they don't like you. I beg you. (but the `There's always a better way` is already bullshit with lots of evidences going around) ugh............., (fuck it, just hug)!!

Nut: (accept hug)!!!!!!

.

.

hug finished

.

Lug: (here's the at least consolation of the `better way` too bullshit, breath in nose)..., just don't get yourself hurt. If you got to ***defend your place***, I won't stop you. Just... ***arrest them***. Send them to the police first since we had it here. (This planet Police is corrupt) But eh.. ***Don't kill them***, ***stun***, or what.

Nut: (tear)... Okay. I'll try my best.

.

.

.

Lug: Goodbye.., (turn around & leave this planet)

B roll slow motion Lug walk towards the ship, going towards Erem & Parim awaiting at the ship's door.....

.

Jump cut to Ship has sailed towards the portal. Portal then closes.

The vibe then turns deaf that stabs your ears to bleed, tho it's silent and windless day.

Nut ponders the now emptied rail and ring, just a bit more time.

.

## But then

Uh oh, it was announced an avoidable & indestructible meteor is going to hit this planet. Everyone has been instructed to leave. The government has prepared arks to leave to Cartesians of choosings. Nut chose to buy another ship and migrate everything with it.

Nut: CHECK AGAIN, CHECK AGAIN! NOBODY SHALL BE LEFT!!

Beads Weldman: Squeaky clean, sir! Nothing's left but rusts.

The workshop all has been gutted, into the ship.

Nut walked slowly entering the ship's door. The going time in sync is only in 12 days, so they got more times. Although...

Beads: We got 12 days left before we all must leave. Would you like to do something else first?

Unfortunately, gamers cannot choose to do anything else to buy some loots to fullfill the ship. Later. I mean forget about it.

Nut: Nah, fuck it. We go.

Beads: Wait, you sure, sir?

Nut: Just do it, idc! What if suddenly it goes in now, no risk allowed?

Beads: (Valid reasoning)...., Hope you don't (go to front deck) regret this decision...

Nut: ... (close door & follow front deck)

Jump cut! The ship has sailed the other way butting the first ship rail.

Title **South Cartesian**

## Flashback

Once upon a time, in childhood days, School orientation days, rest time, Nut was riding spring horse alone.

Suddenly, the tough kids approaches Nut. He found prey. Stary fisting Nut.

bok bak bik buk! Nut is huert, cornered.

But then a hero came. Hit back of bully's head with a wrench found in the warehouse. Stunned and syncope.

Lug: Nut? isn't that?

Nut: Who.. who are you?

Lug: Lug, (offer hand) I must help you. Be quick, before the teachers finds us.

Then Lug & Nut washes themselves up, used the First Aid kit stealthily. Now Lug & Nut looks clean, not really, more like after running around playground.

Rest over. back to orientation. The bully awkwardly & ashamedly sits in back corner, and Lug & Nut sits on frontmost side by side. 

Lug's daddy saw it all, notify Nut's parents about this. Then Nut's parents scolded the teacher for failure for not protecting kids from bullying. Resign Nut off the school. Lug also got resigned.

School at the Prison, Crossban. That's how it goes.

## Flashback end

Nut was sitting in his villainly office. Sip the coffee. Put the coffee back to table.

The lair with traps has been completed. This is a maze full of lethal stuffs to the intruders. They installed spike traps, flame thrower, poison darts, arsenic gas, and more across the maze. The Workshop is now a side job.

Beads: (returned and open back the door)!!, Sir, it's done. What do you think?

Nut: (recheck CCTV & feel it).... Hahaaa.. Nice!

Beads: Sir, pls confirm for the last time if this is a good idea first of all. You could hurt your own people here.

Nut: Don't worry, my limbs won't hurt you. Only with my thinking, I will only hurt enemies. Didn't I already taught you to be agile when you were stuck between intruders?

Beads: Yes, sir.

Nut: Is there any other problem?

Beads: (oh shit he's gonna kill me) No sir!...

Nut: (Beads thought he gonna be executed)?, Hey relax. I'm not hurting you. What for, it's just a concern I get it. Point is, that God do not want to answer to revenge. He says `Better ways` without the gib I wanted. Bullshit. So until God gave me really I want, this what can we do. Of course, Burning Bible is moron. But at the same time, we must defend ourselves from the immediate threats. Don't give yourself to try Gods, so this is it.

Beads: .. Yes sir.

Nut: Take a break. I hope we got all the time.
