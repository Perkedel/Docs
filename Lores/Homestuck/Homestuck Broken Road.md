# Broken Road

After the Interpol days.

The ... is passing on an broken road in Alternia. It was remain unfixed to this day. But then today it got *repaired*. Let's see how it looks like

## Reminder

- Sedan. Meenah, Peixes & Chafeur.
- Look at the road. Yikes! What a slop fix! Inconsistent and ugly!
- Let's get to it.
- It feels shaky, and not smooth.
- We made it.
- The asphalt top explodes without fire, transformed into little pebbles and flies up.
- That worker got devastated, fell, use pose animation of Breaking Bad Walter White when best friend got killed in front of him. Drop to ground crying. All went to waste.
- Meenah & Peixes get off the car, turn around and give feedback. *it's good, keep it up 🙃*.
