# Sugih Yanto

Caught the scammeration. Vriska's kids called out the scam of this car repair.

## Dump Last

- Test Crash train mini. First test is watch out sensor. Train should stop regularly if there is obstruction. Second test is I crashed. When proximity sensor malfunction, train will crash the obstruction. Then this impact sensor should make train hit brake suddenly and ring the alarm. If just hit this test wood plank, it should also trigger this.
- okay, bring it back.
- We finally replaced the panel for Goa Kereta! Yey!
- WarmUp VR. Plugin interstitial for games, to get you warmed up. Do every aspects of stretching before the actual sport game. Each aspect will be done for 8 second. All automatic and only need to follow list, out or in order.
- Beggar perhaps can be chooser, because at least they are not corrupt nand steal internal money?
- buug
- I mean, if am that hectic, I wouldn't be hostile, no idea what for and why would I, did I? Hope not.
- only hostile if they yes, paywalled, proprietary, and partial. That's all. Not for hectic, that's stupid!
- Slipper.
- Make sure you clean your feet too, Terezi, Vriska, yes you all.
- Perspiration attracts bacteria and they farts and poops.
- Why the highway fence had slits? Why roads had metal cement tapes in between?
- yeah of course, they were built in parts like LEGO, so that's the slit in between
- Also not tight, to avoid fence to fence collision. You know, road can stress and flexes as cars passes by, and even quakes, low flexibility, can crack. If cracks, it will be that part, not entire road.
- Hey Opera. If you let Lukasz Borges share that latest Aura 3D model, told him to install 69420 r32 parts, allow everyone to make r32 69420s, and the future revisions will immediately $0 download also r34 compliant, **I will install OperaGX in my main PCs**. I confident 101%, you won't do this.
- I mean yeah, challenge myself, what an idiot I am.
- Seriously. I hate no download link. Peck them all. Yeah.
- If you did not download link on that next revision 6 months after the new Aura 3D model release, **I will uninstall OperaGX on all my main PCs**. Deal?
- Same goes for Voicemod. Find somebody better, who will model Protogen and is okay release for $0, allow r32, templates are $0 allow 69420. Remember give salary to that guy. Show Nukude that his action is yeah you know.
