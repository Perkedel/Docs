# SystemD Frethold

Family Guy moment

SystemD and IBM RedHat behind it becomes too evil and controlling nowadays. There are fears that if nobody had power anymore to prevent their disaster, The Whole Linuxing ends just like Windows did. Or worse.

## Begin

Missionary: Hey! GNU! (help hold the boulder) Whoah! What happen?!

Gnu: (energy out, raspy voice) Hheeelp... the RedHat!..

Missionary: Oh no! What is it this time!?

Gnu: They're going to make SystemD based Linux broke if there's just one component did not depends on it! It's DRM!!!, They're planning to watchdog it! So UuUuUgh... fornow..., .....

Missionary: What is it?!?

Gnu: Nothing happens there.. I've warned everyone to go away from SystemD by default, **but they won't listen!!** (only the few niche ones did), AAArgh..

Missionary: You mean.. many common distros did not non-SystemD out of the box & if there's one is just a alternate variant?

Gnu: (nod yes while face pressured)!.!...

Missionary: Urgh.. I had a case where expecting companies to follow someone's opinion from Nebraska due to betrayal going on the mainstream dependencies feels absurd!.. (but this is about IBM RedHat) But I agree this time. What do we do?

Gnu: (Life force zero) Death.

Boulder released

Missionary: wha-**NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!**

Both Gnu & Missionary got crushed by 1000s boulders like Indiana Jones but failed. Those two have gibbed blood meat splattered everywhere.

## wtf bro?

The Missionary & Gnu respawn at their bed.
