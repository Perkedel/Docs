# Too long! Discuss the Dissociation to kill time!

Family Guy Moment

The Trio Parliament of DNB on tour. The ship has been ordered, but it needs long time to arrive to pickup spot. Boring!

## Begin

Orl: Hah. Guess we have to wait for long.

Gurd: Camps ready.

Orl: Great, let's stay here. Until the ship's arrive, we're going to start DPR Meeting here.

Kest: Again? Now is that issue again?

Orl: (open computer) Yep. Remember, we are Main Parliament members, hence we got orders to follow, is this.

Kest: Really?! I should've resigned long ago. Every, single, time!, since its conceiving all of us had to rediscuss this shit again.. and again.

Orl: (still finding) You should not. Nobody is as excell as you are. Finding the replacement is hard. And rejoining in case you changed mind is even haaaarder, due to your infidelity. (page arrived) So, `Author Dissociation`. What are we going to do, accept, object?

Kest: Fine 💢. Why not you make it Nepotistic? If that guy betrayed us then it should just hit that guy, simple as fuck! Don't you think?

Orl: Alright, `Nepotism`, good question, (start go to page about it) been talked one sec..

Kest: Oh really? Everybody knows?

Orl: Yep.

Kest: (bruh) 🫥 Uhh h.. Why.., do we have to

Orl: Well it has to. I know this sucks, but... eventually it had to be done coz so many citizen tired of this Bullshit made by their closest loved one, how many knows. Already... (reached) `Nepotism`. *Not only it's unfair & rectangle, ultimately ends up self centered*, which in this timeline..., Kaorfa himself. He can deem whatever he has been hurted to, unworthy anymore. bla bla bla, but not himself. No. That is not okay. He can be also villain realizingly or not. So still, go back to here. At least in the end it's just gonna stuck again just before the final door. Never to be touched again atleast for another decade. Or not, idk.

Kest: (he got the point, and it sucks).... Fine whatever you want.

Orl: Well careful, that gonna hits you as well. One wrong move, bye bye your identity pride. Forks gonna stab you back & forth the next tick of life you went rogue in a bad way.

Kest: Ugh.. I wish things gone differently... (but that's also asshole)... uhhhmmm

Orl: By default, abstaining means reject here. That may lead to another type of problem

Kest: Okay fuck this shit yes. Why did I gotta be here, when corrupt nations lives lavishly
