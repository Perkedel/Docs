# Cripple the Legacy Car

The age of EV has reached the mainstream. Despite of this, people still believe in ICE. While let's say all refuelings are for Electrics either 1 to 1 against the Petrol & Diesel, or outright no more, Nevertheless, People also belive EV is just a fate of Algorithm Overloads. It's just like a TV, when dumb TV is no more, and is to Smart TV. And to keep Smart TV cheap, they put Algorithms where brokers pays view appreciation to the manufacturer everytime. So that's how these manufacturers kept afloat even burning lots of cash.

Eventually also, Cars, may do the same. The Legacy, Hybrids of all kinds, will be gone. And to keep price down, they would.. advertise on anything.

## Cripletown

A woman bought herself one of the last legacy car. Manufacturer was the most famous and trusted brand, which reputation had been long built since long ago.

At first, the cars works normally. It got smart features in it. Very convenient, you can connect your phone to its info & make it an external monitor for GPS purpose. Life, was peaceful.

Suddenly, the car makes notification for regular maintentance. Fine, that's cool too, let's go to Service Center. Leave the servicemen do the checkups while you sit like an NPC at their loungue. The car is okay, and you can use it again. Life was peaceful.

2 Years pass, the car suddenly broke. A part broke, which if not fixed is dangerous to drive. Let's go to Service Center. But then, even though nobody wants legacy cars but this woman here, they say, *parts discontinued*. yadi yada, you have to buy EV. Look, there are customers doing maintenance, and these are EVs. **HOAX!!** Liar!!, the woman internally shouts, that it seems there's lots of Planned Obsolesence in it, so you got to get paycheck, unethically.

Oh fucking hell! They made legacy car intentionally broke, so I buy EV, and then doomed into paying everafter to a part that was supposedly survive. It's a trap!! Let's go to unofficial! It's repaired, everything's fine. It's not original parts tho, coz the pirate servicemen had learned everything about it. We all been trapped. Life becomes hell.

another 3 years. After been unchecked, all bypassed, the car literally broke. Let's return to the Pirate Service. They got the parts, all the expertise and reverse engineerings. But then when last screw closed after the broke replaced, **DUar!!!** The car combust from its computer system, like an EV that catches on fire, that actually it was that, not the battery at the bottom bed! They made the chip inside shorts when fixed unofficially! A confidential info was ust found out, the official service center biometrically reset the trip after the maintenance and planned obsolesence agreement in check. Luckily, the Pirate previously told her to sit at their loungue. They told her to lock the door herself while the pirate servicemen going to repair it. Here's your stuffs from the car, keep it. And so everything else, that makes the woman suspicious, what the hell you're going to do with my car? Trust me, I felt something horrible in it. And that's right, that happened. It worths an illegal callouts, but I assume, laws now been sponsored way beyond salvation. Life, **is hell**.

Where do we go now?

## Intermission: How would it catches fire

Let me hypothesize this. How would an EV catch fire? I've got two possibilities: Output, or the Batteries themselves.

I would say, **The output**. Bad wirings and troublesome BMS will cause short circuit. When it catches fire, chances are, autopsy forensics would find that.. it comes from the Infotainment system. I wonder.

And funny enough, the beds where the battery is, yes while there's also a chance also, **Intact sometimes**. If they had to explodes chances are, manufacturers already knew this. By the time it happened, you only suddenly lose power, a bloat appears at the bottom, with a snow coming out. That's the fire suppression system! Simply take it off, clean it up, and replace it with a new one and you can even call it a day like nothing happened.

The combusting bed therefore is because it was before the safety was put in place, and some bad lucks if there is. So otherwise theoritically, it had all full safety stuffs established!

## Racetrack brand

There were conflicts within Van Elektronische brand. Once upon a time, an engineer missed alot with ICE car. He was a racing fan. Cars these day are all full electric. Boring! All it does when it runs, it hums! Surreal Meme hums, nobody prefers Badass Deafeners ones. So, he collected fellow engineers who had the same goal, and created ICE car.

Of course, this new car right here can't be sold under Van Elektronische brand, coz that'll tarnish them into contributing Pollution. So, they conceived a brand. after a long discussion, it's settled under `Racetrack`. To prevent Van Elektronische from being called out, they wanted to resign, and make Racetrack an independent brand. Well turns out, DNB laws forbid making standalone company registration, if the car you make is ICE. All car companies in DNB realms must only EV. Argh bummer! Fine, then we forcedly stay at Van Elektronische. No no no! Not on my watch, ICE is illegal! you're *punished* (quote on quote)! So, Racetrack HQ is established at a Factory subrealms in Judgement Superrealm. This is all because DNB hates ICE, and they want all vehicles that runs around realms to be EV fully. In any case, there you have it, Racetrack.

Now what to do with Racetrack if distribution is limited? Urgh fine, go ahead, just make it a niche enthusiast secondary driver, that's all. At Vacation Realm, there are enthusiastic Petrolheads longing ever since we conceived this law. Oke thancc! Here are various models we got. Pick what you want and need.

Now we got it. And then, comes back to the first obsolesence scandal above.

As the woman frustrated with Car brands towards EV, killing Legacies and Hybrids of all kinds, The Pirates have recommended her Racetrack brand. Deal in the exchange and rebates, and so there it is. Family MPV, Racetrack. Uh oh tho, **Racetrack only has Manual Transmission!!** I only drive in matic!!!!!! oh shit!!! Don't panic! We know about this. You can set Auto transmission to ON. Now, use these lettered window switches beside the infotainment. This is to emulate Matic: `D` to run, `S` to torque priority, `N` neutral, `R` reverse, and `P` neutral with handbrake. And because the transmission is digital coz there are 3 clutches set, Switching gear is almost seamless, back and forth! The main transmission is robotic, so, you can witness these stick and the handbrake moves themselves as you act. Pretty cool right? The Cruise Control AI is also built-in, and it's the world's first ever Full Self Driving Manual car! The robotic system can change gears so to speak.

Well there you have it. EV got its own prowess and it's simplicity. But we shall not forget the history that makes cars, mainstream in the first place. idk. I am broken I think, Why am I defending Legacy cars? Maybe because The Smartifiers have toxified us?

## How would I drive?

Never take chance to daily drive manual, but here's what I can imagine:

- `S` / Gear 1-ing. The Torque priority trick is used for hill climbing. It has huge gear ratio towards the wheel so it got leverages when otherwise the weight it would bear is way too heavy to lift these all up. In return, when going downhill, the car runs slower instead, thanks to said leveragings that feeds back onto the engine (hence the alternator too). People call this `Engine Brake` effect, because you use lesser actual brake, and let the leverage ratio do the moderation thing. It's also very useful as for regenerative (alternator in effect of this) because the feedback spinning ratio is very high. Now, to unslow it down, just disengage the wheel little bit by bit, with clutch pedal.
- Clutch pedal is used to disengage the wheel & engine. Obviously, it's not binary, like Piano Sustain, so you can partially disengage for something a bit. That's why you press it down fully when changing gears, so that the wheel while still has momentum does not immediately bites onto partially connected new gear set that would wear it faster, or bassically stalled the engine coz momentum desyncs and clashes. Clutch itself is like a brake pads, that it's its own mechanics. It's like this to allow said partial bridging hence synchronizability as changes of gears. Had it's like dovetail, it'd always explode everytime.
- Because of this quirk, say you're going to stop from a high speed. It is often times recommended to **keep the gears engaged instead & avoid clutch pedal**, to have the `Engine Brake` effect also involved. This will relieve stress on your brake pads at least a bit. **Then as when the car slowed to stop enough, clutch pedal so it won't stall**, because the wheel speed is now going to be too different for it.
- But if just a usual stop from normal speed, **Clutch pedal first, & brake**. Remember, just a few tic too desync will stall the engine. This is quite tricky!!
- You won't notice this with Matic car usually, because the computer handles it for you. If you wanted to stop, you'd always think Brake Pedal. That's it.
- The Wind Blow Boat trick. Say you're climbing up high from park. Play these two pedal. While Gas Pedaling, Play around with the Clutch Engagement. Various Combos such as `Momentum charge` (gas high, smack release clutch when flywheel momentum is full, this can risk stall often times), `Blow the boat` (gas & clutch release bit by bit like Mercedes Maybach Jumping out of the sand), `Fuck it` (gas & release clutch if you are confident that the gearing like this with slope angle would work) are available you can use to achive the goal. It's like blowing boat from tilt water, breath in to collect air, and then blow it out to push it. Again, computerized / matic cars play these for you (infact more precise if the system is sophisticaed with gyro and accelerometer and stuffs), just Gas Pedal and hope you climbed.
- Like with everything computerized, as you are tired a sec, you'd Brake hold in place to take a breath. And yess, cars with Brake Hold feature will do that like so for you. The understanding in fact is very simple, when stopped and at slope, then it'd brake right away.
- Lazy Acceleration. Another quirk of of Clutch, because Engine that's on, and on gear, always running, whenever it bites onto the wheel it runs. The Accelerate Pedal is basically to Open Carburetor more. Unpressed Accelerator means the carburetor still is open partially, to keep the engine running, otherwise suffocating it stalls the engine. This is why Lazy Acceleration exist. If at this wide the carburetor open (even unpedaled, just idle) and it's still strong enough instead of could stall, you can simply slowly and carefully release Clutch to have it cruise slowly. Again, not all engine supports this, so your kilometerage may vary. Best bet is anyway to Accelerate (open carburetor to enough air that outputs enough torque as the result) and Carefully release Clutch, like usual.

## great

I'd still pick EV. The Van Elektronische ones. But I also will sometimes drive this new Racetrack, coz I made it!.
