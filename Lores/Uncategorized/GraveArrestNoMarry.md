# Grave Arrest: Nope to Marry

Family Guy Moment

## Precutaway

Damn. We fixed the abusive job. Nowadays jobs are chill yet..., nobody wants to have marry. I am afraid we'll be extinct, and the latest president would gone wrathful he see it again next census.

## Begin

A corpse in a coffin placed in a center of Judgement court room. This dead guy has been arrested after his age death, and during his life that he voluntarily refused to marry.

If you castract yourself without marriage, you will be punished. And if you die old, failing to marry, or even found voluntarily not marrying, that's also punishable.

The Judge strikes wooden hammer 3 times, after he gave the sentence. The punishment is to be burried in a special gravespot forever for this type criminals. His DNA will also be sampled, and replicated, to make gene sample for another made up human project, or donored with another alive partner. You should've had married, sex, and get at least 2 descendants out of it.
