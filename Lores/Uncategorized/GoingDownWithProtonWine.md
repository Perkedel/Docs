# Going down with Proton Wine

The Video Game refuses on Linux for many, many many excuses. The missionary forcedly has to do something in the end.

Family guy moment southpark simpson

## Begin

Missionary has returned to the Video Game, and shared new intel.

Video Game: Huh, returned again huh? Didn't I tell you already, Linux Displaying is still a mess. Don't you dare, ignore the conflicts between X.org, henceforth XLibre, and the now Wayland that's still be fullfilled by the people full of themselves!.

Mr. Missionary: I have new intel!! Hear me out! Microsoft these days is also full of themselves! No more the days of Windows 7, or at least 10! It's all now AI, AI AI AI AI everywhere, core becomes AI! OLL..., in Windows 11. You will have more burden every single get-rids you done to it.

Video Game: Silence! FreeBSD, ... OpenBSD, ... and their derivatives, way too niche for my profiteering. My goal here is to cater to my audience. Just so you know I've recently heard rumors from [Mr. Bryan](https://youtube.com/@lunduke), forgor which sauce it was, but trust me: **Haiku developers were also full of themselves!!!**, They do not accept any of us!, whose had a default principle your father & your family have been holding strong, for your God. The same hatred done on everything in FreeDesktop (x.org then wayland), GNOME, everywhere else. Bazzite? the Fedora? 'so you know, they too.. have... [**BENDED**](https://youtu.be/w5OGVfvNsQc) (`tekuk` (other word `B` of it))!, (skip Chimera & others, way too long to hear; Fear Cachy despite no sus lately would all the way sudden be in) who knows, who came for more? .... Beside, ReactOS still way ahead to go, I no longer foreseeing evermore, coz I've wasted alot of time, therefore money had I kept at it.

Missionary ran out of option. Therefore, he had no choice but to use his Ultimate skill, that he wish never used in life.

Video Game: It's over, kid. Nobody can help you anymore, coz now they're busy of themselves. Stay!., Is how we live today.

Mr. Missionary: .... Fine. **THen you (execute skill) go down with me!!**, in (fire) **Proton Wine**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The whole building absorbed into a blackhole of Proton Wine

Anti-Cheat: **REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**

Video Game: YOU CANNOT KEEP WINNING! YOU CAN'T KEEP WINNING THIS!!! YOU SHALL NOT WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Finally. Almost all Windows Games even untested works on Linux. Thancc Gabe! & everyone involved

Video Game: FFS!, you cheated! You're only Emulating Windows Compatibilities for yourselves!
