Family guy moment

## Begin

The Assignment flew far whoosh

.

But then on the left side of the scene, the same Assignment seamlessly teleported to there and continued whooshing back to A

BONK!! eXPLOSION AGAIN!

A: OAAARGH!! (Disagree with this ever lingering assignment) ?!??!?!?!?, (can only scream in agony) EUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!......, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
