# Trashiest Employee

Whose employee, with the most trash on their desk?

Family guy moment

## Begin

Olter: MAREQ!! PLS, SLOW DOWN!!

Mareq arrived at this room. Mareq look those employee in this room has lined up right ahead.

Olter: (follow) Oh shit..., (arrived), Ugh, Ahem! Ladies & Gentlemen, Mr. Mareq. Hygienics. (add stress because Mareq is indifferent guy for cleanliness) uh...

Mareq: Alright, no need for long time, let's see (scanning)......, (nose found dirtiest employee), (point at Toleb) You.

Toleb: Me, sir?

Mareq: I apologize, but it seems that you, are the Trashiest Employee. Please take the bus we have provided-

Chokam: WAIT!! Tf you talkin about?!, Toleb's desk clean!, look!

Indeed, Toleb's desk only got default set of Keyboard n Mouse, Monitor, few stationaries neatly tidied up in a mug. The mug only has 2 pens (each red, blue, and black), Correction tape & fluid, 30 cm ruler, and a selotape roll in a snail. That's it.

Chokam: Okay, he can be trashy at times, but that's because we were having hectic job last week. But then, he always cleaned up everything once he's done, we done, all done. Next day I come earlier than him it's squeaky clean! Take me instead! Look!

And Chokam's desk is scattered. a few tissues used to wipe inks also there.

Mareq: (verfied) Your brain can remember things. But have you seen his house, (take out tablet PC), (load the stalking footage off of brain onto Table PC)...., This?

But despite Toleb's cleanliness look, his own house desk is the contrast of all. Uncleaned perishables packagings are also there to this day.

Chokam: (we've been stalked all this time by the government) Houe?!?!, (Try punch) YOU STALKING MOTHERFUCKER!!

Olter: (managed to hold) HEY HEY HYE, DON'T PUNCH THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL!!..

Chokam: You are NOT GONNA STALK us everyday like this to see our background! DO NOT!!

Olter: Yes yes yes,.. but we

Chokam: ISSUE DIVERSIOOOON!!

Speaking of issue diversion, Godi reminded about life situations. brain execute scan life situations. There's still corruption going on as usual, and right now is about 13 billion worth of Pts. money laundering to save his wretched son that accidentally killed a woman when the son threatened her for something son does not like she did.

Godi can only shout quietly

Godi: (maximum volume but still normal speaking volume) Guys!..

Chokam: Toleb! Do not accept any government says to you! You're the cleanest person you could ever be, we're so jealous of you, pls teach us how to build this habbit!

Godi: Agree.

Burk: YEA!!! YOU'RE THE EXAMPLE!

Mareq: C'mon!, don't waste anymore time than I already lost. Off you go, son.

Toleb couldn't do anything to retaliate than to follow order.

Unfortunately that's how it ends. Few minutes later

Chokam: You could've just syncope him?

Olter: I WANTED TO!!, ... It's government official. This company license of operation was of course blessed in this government. I wish. And if I reckless, (take & ponder license card) this gone.

Chokam: God!!... Don't you understand, stalking with sole purpose of finding fault is unethical! The whole rulings hypocrise one another, God knows how many and which paths they been.
