# The Clone Fake No Die

A bunch of clone of a man. The clone always respect the original. It is Robot, that can emulate the man humanness one to one. He is successful and the patent is open source years later.

The original man is already dead long ago, and people thought he's one of a deity that himself is long ager. Nah nope, it was just a bunch of clones now.

The original man used this trick to protect himself, coz the enemy acts only if the original man is dead. Thankfully, the whole enemy already bankrupt without the death known. It is now safe to open source whole intel about it also.
