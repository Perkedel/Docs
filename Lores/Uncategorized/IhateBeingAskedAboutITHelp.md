# I hate kept being asked about IT Help

Family Guy Moment

## Begin

This, is A. A is IT Expert. A has been fed up from elders who kept asking stupid help regarding IT.

A: Welcome to my house... uncles & aunties. I have a rule here. If you're asking about IT help, and I give you this coin

Red coin saying `STUPID\nHELP`

A: You have to stop. You're asking stupid help. I already taught you many times that how.

A's elders does not have the disease. They're just refuse to keep the memory of it

A: (give red coin) Stop. That's stupid help.

H: You lack of decorum..!, This finding me the Excel on this computer is complicated, you know?..!..

A: (more fed up, point finger) **COIN!!!**

Mama Y: (startled panik) JESUS CHRIST ON RANGE ROVER!..

A: Ugh!! Alt + Space, `Excel`, Right click, `Add` to fucking start (Pin to Start Menu)!!.

H: (follow).... (lost language, scold too heavy)..

A: (confirmed success), (upset leaving).... (small volume) stupid uncle, skipping IT class..

And suddenly A got coronary blockage. He collapsed when one day doing something. Luckily, their emergency reponders arrived fast and caught A in time.

### Hospital

Doc C: Mr. A. We have installed the stent down at your apex coronary. Honestly I am surprised how in the world did you managed to accumulate LDL at this young age. You're.. 25, right?

A: (weak) Uuuuuhghm... (unable to understand cardiology jargons) Doc... speak English will ya?....

C: Uhm... T-(cancel, he might not understand `TLDR`).., Basically we rescued you from death. You're not Heaven yet. You have heart attack, your heart did stopped beating, but we managed to unstop it. We... cracked open your chest to fix what's wrong.

A: Ugh... do you really I'm 12, telling me intel that way?

C: (felt awry, attempt to hold composure) Ughm.., (tell brain instead, maybe his brain is not damaged then) I'm glad you're alright. Forgive my lack of decorum. I was very desperate to save you from death. Many people failed to make it just so you know.

A: Fuck..., How did I turned like this?...

Ms. E: Doc, here's the result.. (give)

C: (take and examine)!, (examine)?...... You ate too much.. fried foods.

A: Stop reading my mind, will ya?!

C: Sir, you must be careful of the protein you consume. Here, (give recipe) claim your medicine from apotecary down stair. You must increase HDL, which you can find from vegetables.

A: Yuck!

C: Burgers. Plant Burgers with lettuce and pickles, the default plant burger, since you don't like raw leaves.

A: Huh?

C: We've been had one since 30s

### Recovered

Eventually, A has been recovered from heart problems. He lost all his cortisols after the incident and no longer possess the will to scold who kept asking of stupid IT help. Thankfully since the circumstance, everyone cooperates and won't bother him of that anymore, because thank God, the hospital hired Overseers to train the elders the basics of CompTIA.

The scold coin since then has stopped. A is no longer bothered of stupid IT help.
