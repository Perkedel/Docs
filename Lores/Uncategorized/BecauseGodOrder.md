A: What's going on?

### Judgement Realm Prisoners Press Room

C: Mr. A. Here are the suspects we caught for wrong teaching crimes. Do you want to say something?

A: I have.

C: Then you go. Next hour prosecution begins.

A: Dear fellow inmates! Hear me out! Once upon a time there are groups of other companies were tried to research why [bacon is haram](https://youtu.be/hepeHgwCnS8). Out of some, ones did convince to stop doing this coz they thought it's bullshit. In the end the company fail, coz why is that?

.

A: **God's Order**. Everything, even scientific findings is anyway made invalid, only because **God says them to not so**. We back there could only watch, and internally disappointed, but eh, story's story, put that aside, fun fact history lesson. Anyway point is, **we're going to weaponize this exact reason against y'all guys**, coz no matter how scientific could there be exist or worse, be added up, then YOU WON'T LISTEN!. Stop this wrong!. Why should you stop?

.

A: **IT's God's Order!**, That's right!. It's Adam & Ave, not Adam-Steve, nor Eve-Chloe. You understand?

F: But we are **anti-theis**. We do not follow God. We resist. We no longer blind-side to the existence of God (like Atheis). We realize all He does is to **constrict us to do whatever He please**. No longer free to however we'd like to be. Is this the *be youself* you want?

A: Ah. Very well. I guess I've underestimated you. I can feel your cells. You're not somebody uncommon afterall (i.e. God's creation, out of clay, not other god's) in case you missed that. Well then., I'll give you (thinking)....., 30 Minutes, to contemplate. All before you face the Judgement. (turn head left), (async) (internal signal raise white flag surrender, they're way too strong of a head / bebal)!!!

C: (async) (noticed distress)??... (nod acknowledge)!., (stand up off chair & rescue A)!, Alright, thank you.

A return to back stage

C: So, 30 minutes, or uh (remeasure total).. 1 hour left. So think again, do you think this self entitlement doing is correct, or not, whatever beliefs you had which mostly parasitize everyone yadi yada. Okay? I'll sit & watch you, (reach chair) I can wait.., Just don't fight. Start now (sitt).

F: I told you. Stop trusting God. You should've had listened.

A: Then what do you want me to do with this information? Be like you??!!

F: Correct.

A: Ugh..., Let's say that indeed God does not exist, or does but a jackass like you said. **No**. We still won't do it. Please do not shove opinions we do not like. Since you're at our lands, You must respect the house rule, or else I'll call you trespassing. so **a man is to marry a woman**. End of the line.

F: Haha.. You got a point. Fine, I'll find somewhere else.

A: And I will conquer again. See who wins.
