## Remind

- Missionary called to cure this girl. She has multiple personalities disorder
- Where's all doctor? why me?
- Well yeah, they start charging more! And other more I could buy graduated with GPT AI Oh shit.
- Whoah, that corrupt? Lemme check what is this place? ... Oh it's not DNB. And you called me because I bless stuffs. One sec, pray
- What are you | ssshh! ....
- .
- After finish got bless needed. Here's the idea, tap forehead.
- 2 of her alternates are transfered to new bodies each. The bodies manufactured in place like how first ever human created.
- There you go, you got 3 twins. Sorry it's failure, coz God gave me the bless that does not kill the alternates, He said it's murder so He chose this one instead, at the cost must feed and care these 2 new now. But hey, at least you didn't have to pay fortune, coz it's an utter failure.
- Here, take it. Pls just accept. This is between you and us. Basically do never let her employer know anything about this.
- Okay? Who's that?
- This person. She must be BLOCKED. If you ever got a contact that's her or any of her subordinate, Block and report her to the Neo-police.
- wtf, DNB forbid outright Blocking (internal), then it's something huge beef, must've been so bad!; Okay.. I'll be careful.
- Pls, this is life and death for my family. She is monster!
