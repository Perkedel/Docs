Every Hoax Detector call outs uploaded requires other members of POC Police to review. At least 10 approvals before it can shows up.

Unlike most case on Terra, in DNB, Hoax Detector added post does not mean bad. Sometimes a post missed an important context, or there's a new update a poster may not have time to edit it. If the post can be told subtly i.e. not too important or not urgent, the section box will also be subtle.
