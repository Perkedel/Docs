# Burnt the Bridge

family guy moment

## Begin

Winged: Ugh! There's this nasty bridge spawned, at last. Those enemies have figured out how they go here to make more ransacks! ... No big deal, I'll just get rid of this

Advisory: Sir, I have to warn you. The Across have been accessing us for 10 years already. If we destroy this bridge, we will have unintended consequences! Pls, **Do not burn the bridge**, even they are enemies. We may need them to salvage as much as possible those who still with us.

Winged: Excuse me?, Advisory, you usually told me all based tips. What liquor did you consumed last vacation?

Advisory: Huh? (loading past event) Umm...., (loaded) Cocktail `Bowling`..., contains Tuti Fruti, and 20 ml of Heritage (a Gin tonic).

Winged: .... I belive you should take a break. I understand days been busy lately, so let this delusional take a rid and never rise again. So, I'll destroy this, (wand mode to delete), (touch the bridge)...!

The Across bridge turns to dust.

The whole Across buildings and facilities turned to dust. Left just the people there.

Winged: Perfect.

Advisory: Also if you ask if we could have material... sorry. We out of. We used all of them to build combat stuffs. No more quality material we got left since.

Miner: (PTT)! Advisor! We lost the raw Titanium! Thank God we survived the fall, everything turns to dust and the whole place is sinkhole all of the sudden! Over!! (Rel)

Advisor: Well, there goes the ingredient we need (for Patent Alloy)., (PTT) Acknowledge. On it, over (rel)

Military: (rushed arrive)!!!!, Sir (salute)!, Report: All our stuffs turned to dust.
