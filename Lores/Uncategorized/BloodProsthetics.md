## Begin

HR: Mr, you have prosthetics. It's electronic, so your job assignment would be limited.

Candidate: Oh.. Yeah uh.. that..

HR: May I know, why your **blood is synthetics**?

Candidate: I was contracted HIV/AIDS. Yeah-uh... you know F..Freddy

HR: (Freddy Mercury from QUEEN is gay, bla bla bla contracted this exact incurable virus) Ah, I know that guy. Really?

Candidate: Pls.. This is the only company left that accept my submission. I've accepted interviews of all, but all of them ghosted me. I sensed the code what that means, so pls! This for my life!

HR: Alright!.. Alright.. you're in. Our company is just to (offer point to the unoccupied desk with Workstation PC) prevent AI replacement. You're here for 3D Modeling right?

Candidate: Yes!

HR: Go ahead try the stuffs over there you'll use. Work start by next monday. In by 7.30, break 12, 30 minutes, go on 'til 6 PM.

Candidate: (immediately went to the desk) got it!

## Begin 2

Candidate: Excuse me, about 2 days ago.

HR: Hmm?

Candidate: Why did you concern of my biological status?

HR: Oh, that... 3D Modeler will have a second jobdesk.

Candidate: ...

HR: is to do Motion Capture.

Candidate: Huh.

HR: If I'm not mistaken, the people with Sarkomen made-up blood may lost naturality during motion recording. Everything would seems like robot, so.. I want you to disable *Heartbeat Compensation* when your time has come for the assignment there. I believe the patch has been released just yesterday.

Candidate: I did (updated the blood firmware)!. .. Just.. feels weird. I thought All I would do is just use mouse & keyboard to Blender..

HR: My apologies. This department scans biological specs for said Motion Capture job. Come read the document in our FTP server at `Handbook/3DModeler` later. You'll see why.

Candidate: Got it..
