## Act 6: Surrender

Eventually, Try tried [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/). This Reference Distro successfully installed, and indeed, no Outfit Change triggered as the Omarchy's nature says.

Logged in

Try: .................... (pre-installed app provided mismatches lots of preferences) I AM NOT, SATISFIED!! ..... NO!!. URGH!!!

Then he switched to [Cachy](https://cachyos.org/).

Try: ......

Try can only be silent. With that in mind, will he be hopeful in the computing world? Who's to blame? The air, The politicians that happens to be developer of those all, or the callouts (Lunduke, Babylon Bee) including Joel that programmed these all macros?

JOELwindows7: The fuck dude! Why me?! I wrote you guys! We're filming now!

Relax, just kidding!, geez!, And so, Try should try an 8-bit computing all the way back to.. Commodore 64.
