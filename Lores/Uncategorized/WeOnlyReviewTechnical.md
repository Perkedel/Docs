# We only review technicals

We firstly have to apologize for any review you deemed mistake, when it should've been it this, and not what did. This is because our rule sets the review to cover technical stuffs, and avoid covering non-technical stuffs such as the interactions. We hope you understand

However, we are currently discussing for the possibility of changes. This would include last experiences to be included in the review and affects the verdict of each. Additionally, this changes will also updates previously published reviews as well to better warn others to make awareness.
