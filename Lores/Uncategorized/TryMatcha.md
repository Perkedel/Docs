# Try Matcha

## Begin

A: So B has going in. Just this one will order a matcha. Remember, Matcha taste like grass, and **if he pukes, that mean it's real**.

C (female): There you go sir.

B: Thank you, (take a sip)!......, .. (nausea, it is grass, yuck)!?!??!,, 

C: Whoah, sir?!

B: (puke) HUWEEEEEEEK (prevent)!!..., (refresh esophagus)!..., (refresh breath), aeh..., (stand up), **Real!!**

C: Whaat?? 😥😥😥😥😥😥

Everyone barged in to order. C is extremely heart broken because he hates the taste and glad at the same time, because then the matcha usurpers (Penyeponk Teh Hijo Rumput) took her entire stocks. C is heart broken crying and smiling while serving the customers queueing up.

all: I want one pls 1 for me yea yea the pure matcha pls yea yea

D: Mmm, yummy!

C: Is.. is it grass to you?

D: Yess, the realest grass, that's what I want.

C: Owh...

D: What is it? Should it be sweet?

C: No!, no.. it's just.. (too shy to say `should've not puke and appreciate whatever`)

D: Apologies on behalf, our rating system is quite the novelty here.

## end

B then consumed bitter resistance potion and bottomed up the glass, and returned to the base.
