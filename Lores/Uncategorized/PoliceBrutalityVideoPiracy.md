# Police Brutality Video Piracy

Family Guy Moment

In a world where the entertainment is hold by cartel strictly. Android TV is a huge failure, because the cartel wants control. All must subscribe just to watch just just just 1 TV channel.

Hence there is a Revolution Rebel to make Entertainment free.

## Begin

Police guy barged in on one of the pirate. Police guy is a best friend with the guy

A: (gun point threat, clumsy because that's his own friend) Hands in the air. You have been prosecuted for piracy of television content.

B: (hands up) Go ahead. Do what you must.

A shivered, the order was to execute him.

B: I have implanted Viralize (on my brain). If you shoot me, the whole universe knows and automatically sets Order of Moderations for us.

A: (you must shoot now!, too doubt) Ugh... (forced feeling, disobey and you die instead)

B: Don't be afraid. This for the good for the rest of us.

A: Yeah.. I'm sorry, (shoot)!!

B died, head exploded gibbed

A: (devastated, you did not die coz you've done the order, but your friend takes the dust, teardrop)!?!??!?!?!... 

B: Thank you. **Pls live** (i.e. don't shoot yourself in the head), and **success me**. (leave scene to Heaven)...

A: Hiks!... (kneel)!! ... ..

Misile explosion kilometers away!

C: THE CARTEL IS DEAD!! WE ARE FREE!!!!

*all*: 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

C: Oh shit!, (Mushroom) Cloud, hide!!
