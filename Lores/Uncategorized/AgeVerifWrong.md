# Age Verif Wrong

How did this happened? How was it went?

- No ID Card. They think asking ID card is bad idea, and make people run away. How would we verify if they are 18 years old, without having to look at their government ID?
- Select Age Number. So they picked this instead. Abusably, they could leave mistake of making it hard to edit. If there's an incident, it could potentially cause false age lie. MultiTalent Bottom Cartesian Rail Shooter.
- Scan Face. The previous is inefficient, let's choose this instead now. Look at their face and what do you think their age is. This is obviously wrong, coz nowadays, a 60 years old granny looks like a kawaii anime girl! You got the idea. Again, when you've been banned because of lying age (while it's false, you've registered that data years ago, that should've been edited now), now it's because you looked like a kid. And this goes also vice versa, you looked very old, whatever false images it was put, to hunt for more preys that could've had futures. Nobody's trustworthy, and these faces will be abusable. AI or not, unauthorized sampling & pondering, is one of the evil of the evil.

Here's the worse part.

Now that they know Scan face is wrong, why kept going? What's wrong with using Bank's most popular ID scanner? Too Expensive? yes? Too complex? idk if it is. But continuing this idea makes us really suspicious, that they're up to the Island something.
