# Snippet of Duron

Duron Sediron likes to read *real name* of every person. He likes to reveal the target and uncover the true form. No matter how strong everyone's disguise magic is, Duron always able to uncover the original looks of the person.

During Sediron Season 4 Finale movie, when Duron chose to stay in Arder's basement house, at night, Duron did the usual thing when Arder's reaches full sleep. Duron was not able to sleep, stressed after being just rejected by Areluid Kingdom's Science Institute (Areluid is now Arenod Sediron), because Areluid was drowning in suspicions of Balthezer's evil at large. So to tire himself (Duron), he tried to look around, including uncovering original of Arder.  
Duron read that Arder is originally Balthezer. No idea, who Balthezer is, and what background this guy is. Unfortunately Duron couldn't understand the mind flow of Balthezer, either it's encrypted or too different format. At least tho, Duron's power does not cause poking effect. Well, maybe Arder / Balthezer encrypted it for a reason, best not to pry then.

As Duron's power emanates, the signal went heard onto the Areluid's office, that night. Immediately after the good morning start, All officers were assembled immediately. Alas, all participants went back home in upset after felt scammed. Luckily, only Sedion family still here, but time is also ticking as they're about to leave.  
When Sediron family was packing up, suddenly the Hotel concierge panikly knock door requesting Duron as the Science Participant to go to Areluid Principal office immediately. The Sediron refuses because they are packing up, but the Hotel concierge insisted. Hotel concierge only receives order because a danger is about to happen, and all participants are requested, reject and accepted. That is, only Sediron's here. Fine, what do you want? Teddy says Stay safe

Duron then meet Areluids. Express upset, and then explain Arder who offered your stay to test his unique building shape hotel service. It was Balthezer. And so Duron read the full detail who Balthezer is, as Duron couldn't understand Balthezer's brain format.  
While the Areluids are talking, Duron accidentally emanates his another power, the reality manipulation. it's a goggleless VR, and Duron plays *Areluid kingdom being ablaze by the evils of Balthezer, everyone dies*, as Duron reading through the intel of Balthezer, in shock of who real Balthezer is. Oh no, we're late. Sorry! I can't control myself. Do it again? okeh. We can use this!

And so Duron and Areluid conceived a plan. The Arder is about to sign treaty at glance to make more hotel, when turns out is to conquer Areluid and the whole universe. A trick. keep secret and don't tell your family yet.

and the rest is history.
