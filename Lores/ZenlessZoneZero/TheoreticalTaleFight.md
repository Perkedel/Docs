# Theoretical Talefight

Atttempted to reboot Undertale-Deltarune as a ZZZ Actionings

## What will be changed & stay?

- You can still FIGHT like usual.
- After HP reaches 0, instead of opponent die, you'll first enter a special View: **Judgement**. Here, you have options
  - Dodge to MERCY and spare the opponent.
  - Attack to FIGHT and then destroy the opponent
- You can also use Peaceful Negotiation. This allows you to skip battle and immediately MERCY.

ah dangit. We have to move away from Star Rail system!
