# MultiGun guy

Xahor Direst. Male.

Xahor a.k.a. MultiGun is a handgun wielder. Has a very proficient gunsmarkmanship skill. His signature power as the name implies spawning multiple pistols around him, leaving no room for cover. Similar with Ye Shunguang's Qingming Sword, but it's guns everywhere. He also can spawn bullets right into the magazine, making each of them infinity.

His brain can remember everything, down to its detail, and the exact tick each happened. Much like Blue Archive's Noa, oppposite of Ye Shunguang's Qingming pre counter. This therefore includes all tragedies. When people moved on, Xahor kept being reminded thickly of those all, like it was just happened right now, every single day. He wish he could forgot, but the only to relieve it all e.g. is to revenge until the perpetrators gibbed to atoms. But despite all measures, resurrections & restorations, and all, Xahor kept being thought that they were dead, he was hurt, and lost all the stuffs, even DNB restored everything back like it did not happened.  
*If you could perma-store positive things, why not remind those instead? Nah, that feels boring. Since I had, I want that happened again until I bored. Trust me I tried.*  
*Now, you have the positive things rehappened as you wish, This is the 1001st time now. How do you feel? Yes I am bored. But when you drop it just a day, the negative thinks comes back that tick!! I can't displace those easily anymore, coz we pushed them aside too long! Now they're upset!*

After Arenod Sediron analyzed his gun, they found that beside the gun was an inherits of many generation, **it has the side effect Xahor suffered!!**, opposite of Ye Shunguang's Qingming Sword. It has stored over 20 ExaByte worth of memories, to this day. There is however no game included like does with Qingming's Chronicle Quest where you enter its realm and do missions of history tours and fight. If you entered its mini-realm, you'll only see a Datacenter NAS. With it, you can select random memories, and experience them like VR amusement ride. Therefore, Arenod Sediron can make games out it, a contemplation.  
*Since it has these amounts of memories, at this point, it's just a `TEMP` data. There will be more tragedies, and you are so lucky living in this timeline that we can anytime restore it all like it did not happened, and revenge it all just for you. Will you BleachBit it all? Yes, I wanted to. Sounds like you're not serious! To move on, is to forget.*
*It does not work! As long I wield this gun & its power, I will remember everything! But you know what, I've learnt it all from Xiao'Guang. If she is willing to forget, she can just trust everyone that loved ones will remember her, including you guys. Now for me, I will just look forward, and I trust you, to keep supporting me forever with positive things, so I can put aside negative things. Yeah like that? There is nobody else like me, or if there is, will be in for a long time. I will responsibly bear these all with all my might!*

## Too Much Information

- Xahor becomes grumpy himself (ironically) as his days of work, where his boss is grumpy & berateful. At one day, he reached his breaking point and uncontrolably gibbed his boss to meatball. This incident & the days before therefore are recorded by the gun and becomes one of those negative memories. Such days of being berated mends him to what he is now. But otherwise somehow, to his friends & families that does not berate, he never showed up any sign of berateness. All the time, he shows only bravery & encouragement, as long as the evil boss does not show up.
- He tried to shoot himself in the head when his reminded of trauma episode gone way too much. The bullet made huge tunnel at the side it shot at, but then the gun cures him. He did not felt any pain, nor loss of conciousness during that. He cannot suicide this way.
- His former personal doctor (now passed away due to age) did suggested to hold a second weapon to reduce usage of the gun. The non-familial riffle did suffice of reducing his reminded episode.
- Unlike Ye Shunguang, Xahor does not suffer from *alternate polarity*. He never see his other self on his life ever, nor could remember he had one on his head. As an Overseer admin worker asked, he laughed and exclaimed. The brain scan says so.

## Zenless Zone Zero

S Tier. Works like Billy but with some differences. 

- You can still roll shoot. Dodge then Attack does the usual 360 shooting.
- Before you fullfilled Heat Meter, Hold Attack is like Xiao'Guang's Ahead Slash & Billy's Forward Shooting.
- You now have Xiao'Guang like second form! After you fullfilled your Heat Meter, without Dodge & off your Forward Shooting, Hold Dodge to activate. You now have multiple guns in the air, and your attack way changes in this mode. Finish it by pressing Ultimate to have Final Gunshot Explosions and then return to normal form.
- The second form's Dodge Attack roll works like DNA's Lynns. You have Autoaim, and whaever camera you aim at your screen will get hit.
- Ultimate otherwise works like Xiao'Guang's. First Ultimate immediately enters the second form, and another press before Heat Meter running out does the finalizing Ultimate like above, then turn back to normal form.

## Duet Night Abyss / West Cartesian

Works like Lynn's with few differences

- Ultimate enters you Autoaim mode, and it works like Lynn's. Once you ran out of Sanity, you'll exit this Ultimate mode and turn back to normal form. You should press Ultimate before that to do above Finalizing Gunshot Explosion.
- Your Special will always do Lynn's spread shot. In Normal is usual half circle, in Ultimate is 360 like Stella Sora's Amber but full circle.

## Extra Proposal

### Second Spirit

The berating becomes way too much, suddenly a second spirit enters Xahor's head and speak on his head, saying hit him till he's dead. Shocked, `oh no!` thinking Xahor acquires Bipolarity like Xiao'Guang, go to doctor. This is gone too much.

Scan

Found the spirit was once lost his body, because of said breaking point went too far. When the spirit retaliate, hell broke lose. The revenge was success, the perpetrator was killed, at the cost of his own body. Okeh, Resurrect the spirit new body, and Judge him further coz maybe you should just hand it to police *right?*, handed over to Judgement Realm. Right??

Ultimate Depression! Now I will kept being reminded of this all. Hey pls don't, he was just a human. Like us. We do not like being treated like this. It's all done, pls brain, and the fucking gun, keep reminded of this instead, since you refuse to forget, do not fucking ignore this memory intel for fuck sake!!. As you can see now, all that's available is to get you out of the boss. here, go to DNB instead, become Overseer. Your life will relax! That behaviour is unacceptable at any companies we DNB Blessed. No no no, let's investigate the berateful boss!
