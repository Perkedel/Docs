# High SDM Indonesian.

Family Guy Moment

## Begin

The Angels of Delusion have been assigned by DNB to help realize this mega-delulu project:

**The High SDM Indonesian** (Orang Indo SDM Tinggi / High HR Quality Indonesian).

By realizing this, all weights will be relieved. e.g., infratructure relieves: Trash Alarm will be relieved, more relaxed monitoring and in effect more energy saved. Previously, We have implemented Temp Stored Face system in the admission, to catch who throw trash recklessly / litters. The other CCTVs saw that guy do that, and we match the face. Thanks to Robo-Police Pact, the Trash Alarm can only alert humans, not allowed to immediately issue fines or YouTube-like strikes whatever. This is very heavy!  
By making all newborn Indonesians fresh from Arenod Sediron, High of SDM, we can assure, most peeople will always make sure that the garbages are collected properly. We can now remove strict admission monitoring and their catch callouts, because they have built-in guilt if the trash did not collect properly.

How it works, we first created the starter seed. These *fairy dust* will be *injected* onto the Angels & The delulus who volunteered. We let it ferment for few weeks, and once it's done, we harvested it, wrangle all the data.  
It results the most unimaginable quality of people in these simulations. All we have to do now is to extract and built ways how can we replicate this Mega-Delulu to real. For one, we can update Crossban standard curriculum to implement discipline system. Inpsired from 1st Kaorfa's school he had ever there (Tunas Bangsa) and our sprinkles of curriculum, we have made perfect requirements to make sure all graduates comes with High SDM.

Not only that, SDM quality only does so much without DNA. Using Genetic Engineering Science, we also have experimented with few fetus, down to the sperms & ovums that make sure the brain can potentially accepts High SDM disciplines, and would have High SDM instinct, just in case. The results appears to be similar compared to non-modified ones, but when there is a case of Crossban blocking incidents (some regions that banned Crossban because of *too strict discipline* whatever this falsehooded people say), Gene-modded graduates shows resentment to their only school and have maintained minimum High SDM instincts and pre-disciplines, compared to those without. More flabbergastingly, they obeyed broken laws of traffic, and default to pay ridiculously huge fines they didn't even do (but no other ways without maybe lethal punishment). Don't worry, we've rescued them after we're done with the experiment, and replenished their mental & financial situations. And about the 666 chip.. we managed to remove them also. Just need to monitor for poison explosion, so far so good.

The High SDM Indonesian Mega-Delulu project will help build better world & relieves many weights that had to be there just to maintain laws & order. When everyone cooperates, and be friendly, any process can be done smoothly, and precisely, all without hassles of selfishness and other unecessary exchanges. They will repect others, maintain peace, and help others in need. This was a huge project and extremely is undertaking. But the result as you can see is way too much worth to skip. If nobody did, then when?
