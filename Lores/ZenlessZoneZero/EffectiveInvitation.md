# Effective Invitation

Ala Duet Night Abyss, *No more Gacha* character & W-Engine, No more perma-locked on expiry & no more rerun required. Replaced with Grind

## Confidential Intel

`Secret Clue`. Currency to buy the Covert Commission items.

A piece of intel about certain proxies & agents across interknot. Even tho maybe just contains useless facts, but all still are sought after amongst many proxies.

## Revealed Intel

`Covert Commission Token`. This now to be used to play that commission on HDD. Again, it will comprises of different items for characters, w-engine, & Bangboo. e.g., `Revealed Intel: Jane Doe` will provide sub-gacha for Jane Doe when pulling.

## Fullfilled Intel

Unlike other MultiTalent games, used up Revealed Intel will first turned into used item called `Fullfilled Intel` of the type and item, rather than immediately rolled up (choose 1 of 3 rewards). You will need to start Pulling on which channels: Characters, W-Engine, or Bangboo.

The Encrypted Master tape now serves as Gacha the skin these days.

## Rolling

You will have roll types / channels:

- Characters. Have all the Fullfilled Intel type Character you got
- W-Engine. Have all the Fullfilled Intel type W-Engine you got
- Bangboo. Have all the Fullfilled Intel type Bangboo you got
- Skins & Accessories. Encrypted Master Tape.

Rolling will choose Fullfilled Intels FIFO. It automatically selects first oldest item in your Save Inventory, and then so on up to 10 per roll. You can just roll 1 if you want. The Roll as all as you have (less than 10 you got, hence roll e.g. 7 of them) is now available!

There is only 1 reward obtainable per item rolled for, to prevent accidentally duding yourself when doing choose 1 of 3 reward like others. No more choose 1 of 3, only the best could be.  
When it resulted, which Fullfilled item will show when the name popped up. It got emotion, as follows:

- S = Happy emotion fx
- A = Upset emotion fx
- B = Depression emotion fx

As usual, if any of the Fullfilled Intel had rolled up S, the Roll first will do Spectacular Intro. *Yeah, the shining golden..*

## Notorious Hunt

Ala Duet Night Abyss *Nocturnal Emission*.

Some Intel of item you wish to get are exclusive & elusive. These repeatable bosses now contains rewards that one of the level grants you those Revealed Intels.  
Usually, about Difficulty 40 ones.

Limit has been increased to 5 a week instead of 3.

### Rotational

The reward can rotate per evolution. e.g.

- Dead End Butcher, the first boss in the story, usually contains prominent Character. Maybe this month is Nekomata, the next rotates into Koleda, so on.
- Sacrifice, the last boss in season 1, usually contains prime Character featured in the story. So you can get Miyabi's Revealed Intel.
- Abominatious, the last boss in Surreal Blender Meme x ZZZ, contains collab Character of that story. This should be Lancaster's Revealed Intel.

## Recycle

If the Revealed Intel is considered ***expired*** and the game has rotated, they will be thrown permanently into Confidential Intel store, instead of rate-up and unique avaiable permanently locked and must await rerun who knows. Now you can re-buy more of them which you want, if you had some that failed the grind gacha.

## Lazy

You can buy Confidential Intel using Polychrome. It's not recommended, because now you can get those Confidential Intels, dropped by enemies doing World Exploration.

## Refund

You can resell the Revealed Intel for Confidential Intel again. Feel free to do this on character you already have, but perhaps a good idea to keep those and keep rerolling until you M6 (ala Intron 6). Then you are free to sell them and get a different type and the item.

## Current Skill Grinds

VR Challenge may also gets overhaul, but otherwise nothing has majorly changed to incompatibilities. You can get upgrade items this way.

Now, not only upgrade items, The VR has new game modes inspired from Duet Night Abyss Commissions.

- Mediation. Destroy the machine enemies prepared.

- etc.

Each has different rewards also.
