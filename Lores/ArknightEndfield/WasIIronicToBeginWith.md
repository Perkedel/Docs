# Was I Ironic to begin with

## Begin

Matrix Gibb: I'm done for.

Duyok: What's going on Matrix? (scan brain)..., Oh..

Matrix: are they the only ones knew?

Duyok: So far.. only ones knew. But Matrix. According to the Overseer Pact, an intel like this that won't mean a danger for inknowledge, shall be eventually told anyways. It is very hurt, but Overseers are not allowed to gaslight or even silence any knowledge of publishable intels to the society.

Matrix: ... (heavy heart sigh) Hhhhh...

Duyok: And it's you, to tell, where the truth intel is from. You!-, sir.

.

.

**tomorrow**

Press Conference day.

Matrix: Good morning, Peers. Today's quick intel is about me. We have been notified that one of our being intels has been... `leaked`. But, such intel here is not eligible for secrecy. So to let you know, it's about Gibb's origin. . (charging confidence)

.

.

.

Matrix: I am, and all Gibbs... Based on Yanese (a.k.a. Chinese Indonesian).

everyone flabbergasted like Iron Man revealed his own name on 1st MCU film.

Matrix: Southern... Yan. But here in my world.. we call that place... China. And specifically, we were.. `Hokien`. But hey... at least I don't have slither of Chinese accent in the slightest, right? If so I'm glad you don't notice this whole time. ... But uh... yeah. (Damn, My reputation gone)!........

.

Chen Qianyu: (pat Matrix) Hey! That mean we're siblings!! Horray! I have sibling!

Matrix: Huh? Umm thancc.. but.. we're not gene

Chen: **Brother from different mother**!

Matrix: (blush, remember a quote long time ago, Duet Night Abyss)!????.... Haha.. yeah. I am your brother, from my Mrs. Gibb. Yes.

Everyone kept paparazi & crazily writing articles & speculations

Matrix: Guys. When I was a kid, we've been exposed to technologies. Since long ago, the Chinese, you call Yan on your world, whatever, anyway... ... already made product. They're terrible. So we resorted to different products. It was happened, the Made in USA is the best of all. Then in late 2000s, Japan. and Korea followed. Never trust China again. And added the fact of various incidents & political agendas, which I don't want to talk about it, coz that'll ruin your mood, no.., Basically, We've long ignored China for quite sometimes, and been focusing on stuffs.

everyone calmed down and increase focus

Matrix: I went to college. That days were so busy. I graduated. 3 of them. And come back to experience more technologies. And guess what happened now. China's good. Previous country sources we trusted on.. gone. Also relied from China again. Even Prestigious Europes too, believe it or not. It's just.. good, and the deals too good. Even some cases, many local manufacturers they were been doing found to be a lie, it's Chinese again. And those people who shouted out loud every possible way to uphold the previous statement it been, looks like Grift Arbiters now. Only sharing the negatives coz they're very desperate, refusing to move forward etc etc etc. Wants it or not, It was the first time I trusted China in my life ever. At first because forced to, that's the only source I have nowadays. **The Glazers.. now look like truth tellers anymore**. One by one. I also have learned. That ODM is not only 1, but a wide range of spectrum. One position means this is a well meticulously made ideas, and another, just a garbage designed to fool desperate people. It's.. variety. All that's left is brain play.

.

.

Matrix: I am succ at making apologies. So here, Forgive me for insulting China, or Yan, lately. I thought they took it all and so hastily, but now it's viable, reliable, and hence default these days. I'm sorry. There. Feel free to reject me, but pls don't drag the whole DNB to that. That's all. (leave scene)

everyone tearmovedly applause slow release

Backstage

Duyok: Good job. Whether or not they will accept your apology means their business to God in Heaven.

Matrix: I hope so

Duyok: NO!.., it is, is. Trust me, They're on bridge, and it's about whether or not they keep the bridge stands, or burn it, which I'll give you spoiler to motivate you, **Idiot**. That's it. DO not. Cancel Culture bad, God will protect us all, (pat pat)! ! relax.

Matrix: Yea man.
