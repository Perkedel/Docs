# Return to Indonesia

The ancestors over there cut way too many trees. All that's left is just dirts and sand.

Reconquer! Endmin & friends will replant Oxygen trees here. the AIC over here will sample existing tree, and then hydroponic loop the tree. Trade these trees.

- Oxytree. A tree created in collaboration with Van Elektronische. Seed Can be extracted with Seed Extractor
- Oxttree Seed. Plant this seed to create Oxytree. Plant this in Planter or Farm plot.

## Other regions

### Palmer / Sawit

Racetrack is running out of gas, again. They thought they only had few enthusiast of this legacy car technology. Nope!

But DNB hates to repeat the same history the ancestors did back then. So once again, DNB asked Endmin and Van Elektronische as the holder of the Science alliance to build better sistem for palming without sacrificing lands.

- Oileaf. A Palm tree that produces oil. Seed can be extracted
- Oileaf Seed. To Plant more Oileaves. Use Planter (Best) or Farm Plot (Extremely not recommended). Requires lots of water like Wuling's, set the Planter to water mode!

Unlike others, **you trade the seeds** instead.

Furthermore, you can build Predefined Lines to produce **Gasoline** that you can use to power Legacy Cars and the Remakes like Racetrack powered Engines. The Machine that powers based on:

- Internal Combustible
- Genset Charger Hybrid
