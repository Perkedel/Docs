# Deploy the AIC to the Basement lab of Mudik Science Center.

How would you deploy the AIC through the Mudik Science Center Building? Well, using portal!

Arenod Sediron inherits this tech from earlier civilization, namely, The Salt Flat World (Sky (not FNF) & Latsufir) & Dasandim, due to the joint research. The Dasandimian started the prototype, then Sky & Latsufir perfected the technology.

With this in mind, it is now possible to bring the Core factory through the building down to the basement directly, while maintaining that badass *drop the bass*.

## Begin

Arenod Sediron approved the AIC after the side effect has been considered too minimal at this point to be concerned about. Endmin confused how would she supposed to bring the deployment drop onto the basement.

Halluo: Okay, right here.

Endministrator: ..., We are in a basement, and therefore the pathway is blocked by the floors above.

Halluo: Oh. So.. how do you bring your AIC then?

Perlica about to speak

Halluo: No no.. I'll uh.. scan your brain. Words may cause miscomms. Endmin, may I?

Endmin: Sure?

Halluo: (reach Endmin) Excuse me., (pat hold her head) just give me a sec, think about the deployment techniques usually, (open scan)...

Endmin think how it's done. You should play the game. But if you're here after it's EOS, we hope we already prepared the New Paradigm remake &/or the Reservered (offline version, whether community or official Offline Steam GOG i.e. Stop Killing Games Protocol) somehow.  
Basically, the badass was like this: Endmin request the AIC core from Dijiang, her space HQ home, rocketed to the place where she wanted it at, whooosh!!! arrived to the planet and hit the ground **BAMM!!!**, here's the box. The screws explode and the box unboxes itself. Tadaa, AIC's here.

.

.

Halluo: (understood) Ahh, I see.

Perlica: Endministrator specifically choses this due to fastest and most efficient way of deployment throughout the planets. The AIC pack is encrypted and only Endmin can deploy it. 

Halluo: (concern Proprietarism)...., (put asside), anyway, (skill deploy Portal).., (open portal from ceiling with other end to the top ceiling of this building)! Okay.

Endmin: May I ask first. Why here? Don't you have an open land?

Halluo: Well that's the problem. Mudik region is all ups and downs. So many mounts here and there so.. difficult and rare to find some flat land. It reminds me... an ancient sub-civilization called... Chongqing if not mistaken...., idea is.. we couldn't find the flat land. Yeah... that's why we... only had West Cartesian. Also, not safe. Who in the right mind put a factory like we're camping? No, Factory must be concealed, put inside. We had all how to chimney all the smoke off from the machines. You got the idea.

Endmin: Hmmm.. make sense.

The Portal is awaiting you, Endmin!

Endmin: Well.. if that works, this will be the first time achievement., **of first ever indoor AIC**.

Perlica: (take tablet)..., (request AIC)......, (done) Okay Endmin. Now it's up to you.

Endmin began authorizing the AIC request. left hand probe there.

**Badass cutscene of AIC deployment**

cling!

**WHOOSH!!!**

atmosphere

Halluo: Wait a minute!..

space armor disengage, 1 of 3

Halluo: We did not bring Dijiang (ommited `to`) this dimension..

Gocce: Looks like Saorfa gave help?

Halluo: O'..

Through the portal and then landed to the basement **BAMMM!!!!!!**

Everyone startled, a quake going on in the room -100.

*everyone*: Woi what was that?! quake?? something smashing! it's normal.. No it's not normal, never felt the quake this big before, like.. space drop experiment or something

Smoke dissipates, reveal the box

Halluo: Whoah.. that was..

screw explodes plotak!

box self unboxing..

Gocce: (Close portal)!

Tada! Here's your AIC fresh from Dijiang!

Halluo: Woahw!!

Gocce: That's was badass.

Halluo: Okeh.. let's just (taking the blueprint from months before)...., (apply)!

Blueprint applies

Halluo: There you go.

Gocce: Keep in mind, Depot currently do not metatransfer yet to here. Just in case, we must prepare basic materials from Hypergryph to here.

Halluo: You mean... bringing the whole veins of Originium and stuffs over??

Gocce: No.. that's too big, also we still can't risk it despite (of Oripathy not working outside Hypergryph proven). Must be something way.

Halluo: Like...

Perlica: Making Originium derivatives with your materials?

Halluo: OH YEAH!! **WULING XIRANITE BUT ARENOD SEDIRON**, YESS!!! ... Hah., Lemme remember. It's carbon.. and uh..

Gocce: 💧 Watah..

Halluo: Hah yeah!, Simple.!!!

But the AIC size is too small, the blueprint applied fullfilled the whole current space size

Halluo: Uh.., (remove one not used now)!.., (think to add Sky Forge).. wait. That thing is (only works on Wuling since it requires Xiraniteful air)... Will it work?

Gocce: ..., 🤷‍♂️!..?

Halluo: Okeh, just YOLO I guess, (put anyway)!...

Now check its interface panel & then!....

Somehow it's compatible. No error popping up.

Halluo: HEH?!. .., ?!...., It... It work?!

Gocce: Impossible.,

Halluo: Nah.. There's no Xiranite here.. Ho-... how?

Gocce: This time I can't figure out how to scan in particular.

Halluo: hmm.... It's... 

Gocce: We must've installed mod in this universe here.

Halluo: Yeah. We might have **Wine** here. ***Hypergryph Is Not Emulator***..

Endmin built the carbon manufacturing parts. Luckily this lab room already had large Water supply on the wall since long ago. build & connect the final system. Then connect the output `Stable Carbon` back to AIC.

.

.

.

Gocce: Well what do you waiting for?

Halluo: Of course yes! (the manufacturing already started, observe) Huh.

.

.

.

.

Here's the "Xiranite", kind of

Halluo: Okay.. similar properties but... it's **blue**. Hah. Interesting.

Gocce: Not Xiranite we usually get.

Halluo: So it's the same Air we breathe.

Gocce: Maybe it's the machines. These machines indeed imports of Hypergryph. Probably contacts with Originium.

Halluo: Possible, but the effective result only works if we had Wuling vibe basically, large amount, full. ... How in the world... Arenod Sediron's air or what vibe..

Gocce: We should not stress about it. Looks like it's a long story.

Halluo: Yeah then.

Gocce: We got it working after all. And so, what should we name this ingredients?

Halluo: Hmmm lemme think.
