# Speaki Strikes Back

Family Guy Moment

Trickal x Endfield?!??!?! pls!

## Begin

Koros found Speaki is cosplaying Endmin and did something to the AIC

Speaki: Oh hi! Look, I have optimized the pathways for the Sediron Batteries.

Koros is tired of Speaki's plagiarist behaviour. Angrily grab lift from her back

Speaki: HUAAAH!!

Koros: You are NOT!-, Endministrator. How many times I have to tell you, stop, plagiarizing someone else!.

Speaki: (in style of that meme) Huaaa, but Speaki think Endmin is cool! So I wanted to be like her, so I can be genius too!

Koros: Ugh... But at least, don't steal her clothings.

Endmin come onto the scene. Still in her default outfit.

Koros: (whew she's not naked or second outfit (latex suit), otherwise big trouble) Oh, Endmin. Sorry, just uh.. little problem. We got Speaki plagiarizing you, again.

Endmin: Please, excuse her. She was like that, but her performance is outstanding.

Koros: Oh really? (look again)..., (yep) Huh., (drop Speaki)

Speaki: Euuuu!!!
