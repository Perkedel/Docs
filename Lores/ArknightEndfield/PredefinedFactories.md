# Predefined Factories

Predefined Factories is a separate factory system away from AIC. These does never take space of any of your PAC areas. You'll get these lines some by some by upgrading that region development levels. Many of these lines only consumes about 100 powers atleast.

Active Predefined Factories now only takes items straight from depot, and immediately manufactures them when ingredients of these becomes enough, and stops when no longer.

It's here to maintain ease of farming like OG Arknights TD game.

Predefined Factories are tangible. You can view them by going inside the building next to each AIC spaces. Like PAC, it has realtime animations too. You can even *steal some samples* on some of each machines.

## Crafting & Predefined Exclusives

Some items, especially foods can only be obtained by crafting. This is very infuriating. So, one of Endmin's friend suggested to make that factoriable too. So there it is. Food factories, as well.

Many Food can now be manufactured automatically, but most of them is only available through Predefined Factories. So does some other non-food items, due to clashing factory recipes. E.g., Computer PSU, is only on Predefined, and you can see mechatronics assembling those units, and have test steps at some points in the way. Like those videos on YouTube. PLS EXAMPLE
