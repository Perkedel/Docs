Let us see if we have the medication for it, (query database of item)..., (found the stock still plenty) Oh wait! (open portal to fetch that sachet), (pour that one sachet), (show sachet)!! We still have one!

Gocce: Wow. 

Halluo: The expiry date is still new, a couple years from now, which mean we imported it back from our Terra to here just a week back, cool!

Gocce: Btw, this company that makes it stand was there about 5 centuries ago.

## You can get Tolak Angin Ice Cream in Real life!

Sidomuncul had a mall in Semarang (the city where they born, and also my mom). The location that you should search is [**Tentrem Mall**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qaS3Gtz9uZuWZDQG8), at `2C7C+8Q Pekunden, Kota Semarang, Jawa Tengah`

There, you can get an ice cream shop that sells Tolak Angin Ice Cream. I hope it's still available tho.

Have fun Ascension!

Laevatain burped. She ate 10 glasses of them.

Halluo: Sorry, Laevatain. The ice cream ran out now.

## Fake Milk??

Once upon a time, people used to fetch milk from living cows, the suitable milk source compatible for most human adults.

But, having to maintain living cows without removing consequences is very hard. Only other way is to make *milk* with some chemicals.

Until now. People have figured out how to replicate cowbreast and so to make realest milk they could ever achieve, without the torture the cows must endure.

The milk is *synthetic*, but comes out the way real cows bio-manufacture them.

pls tell me who's their name again, that was not my invention btw.
