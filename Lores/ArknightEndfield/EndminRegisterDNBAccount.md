# Endministrator Registers DNB Citizenship

Becoming Nationality DNB is very easy unlike in old Terra's Indonesia. Just make KTP DNB, and you're good to go! All sub-account can also be easily made on demand, and renewable on demand.

It's like registering Steam account, and then you sign up DOTA, and others.

## Begin

Arrived in Mudik City Hall. Sub-branch of Arenod Sediron's Citizen Support here in Mudik City.

But first

Brane Craston 27: ..., Mr. Lukro. What you've requested flabbergasted me, personally. You are not a type of person who's into bending rule at all. Is there something ultimately clogged up your mind?

Brane Craston 27 is a genius guy. Very brainy guy. He served North Cartesian since that place is for Scientists. Brane is currently taking side job here right now, because the other brainy people is full on Brane's department. 27 is itteration number, using roman numeral does not fit on many systems. The first Craston comes from Dasandim.

Lukro: Uhhmm.. It's just..

Brane: Alright, lemme compile the action of our protocol Offensive Trial so far, (telepathy download all info ala-AI LLM but it's not) pls wait.. tererererereng..............

.

.

.

.

Brane: (Finished) Okay. So, since year 2150, year you started assumed role, in total we have over 2000 partners passed this Offensive Trial. 27 failed. And yeah, for those ones I don't have to retell you the details, since I trust you still remembered all.

Lukro: (ptsd) yeah yeah pls no., Next.

Brane: So far so good. But, That side which I must tell, the consequence cause DNB loathed and regatekept even more, like...

Lukro: China, I know.

Brane: & Worse. (anyway).., And today, you.. want to change.

Lukro: Yeah uh..

Brane: (telepathy downloaded Lukro) Accumulated too much... `Derangement`. And keep doing this would cause unexpected sudden downfall of DNB beyond our control, all because we kept following protocol. We can't keep farming negative energy, .. just to protect DNB, is that you say?

Lukro: (telepathy poke aware) Well you my head. Not only that. I... somehow.. no, have heart.. I huerted Endmin's heart.

Brane: Mmmm..., I see. Honestly that's weird, you usually is indifferent. But.. something about Endministrator *awaken your pure heart* (hati nurani)?

Lukro: yea, like that..

Brane: So.. the proposal paper is ready, here it is..

Lukro: (examine)

Brane: I will also recall your old friends. Many of them lived in Embarrasser departments.

Embarrasser is Lambe Turah of DNB. They used to be the deadliest doxxer ala CIA, four, and farm groups combined. After the Great Consequences in 2170, these doxxers must retreat for safety and now only share embarrassing facts. But their prowess never dim by generation and when world grims again, their additional 0.001% power like used to be will activate.

Lukro: Huh, okay. Seems they hate not using weapons like times to be huh?

Brane: Let me reitterate this traditional ways. Accept, and Scan (Spyware like corporations but without Free Apps). If you found they're Impostor, you let your team know.

Lukro: Got it. Still back of my band. Tolerance?

Brane: Tolerance against KDRT (Kekerasan Dalam Rumah Tangga / Domestic Violence, i.e. Post acquaintance betrayal) Suffering has increased over the past few decades. People has habit to report any incident to DNB, you'll know the next second.

Lukro: Good.

Brane: Is there anything else?

Lukro: Send it. Nothing else.

Brane: Okay, I have told DNB just now. They will review this promptly. Thank you for using DNB Customer Service

Lukro: (stand up)!!, Wooh! Finally.!., (leave this place)...
