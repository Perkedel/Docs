# How Reconvener reasons in Perkedel Cinematic Universe?

## What is Reconvener?

**It's a clone.**

Koros: Huh? `Reconvener`??

Gocce: Clone.

Koros: Oh..

here [pianime94's theory](https://youtu.be/4kUoyiHp8U) 

in Arknights world, one of the way to be reconvened is have your conciousness recorded onto the Originium Assimilated Universe. One of the way is either you got Oripathy, direct Priestest *invitation*, or blightful originium explosions something2 which opens up the AU gate. Basically, once you're recorded, the data's there. bla bla bla, these data then eventually born into a brand new person. Had those specs of the record, but is not the same as the OG.

You already experienced the Laevatain's Operator Story. You can see, Laevatain is clone of Surtr. Had amnesia like Surtr, and fragmented memory of that of Surtr. And as it goes, because Laevatain is a Rescratch some sort, she is of her own, then, it's just do a new journey. The past is the past.

So on so forth. That's why you'll see familiar faces of these Operators you'll hire (or Gacha for those who played original Endfield). They're that clones, and of course different, like they're a new generation of each.

Like Endministrator, These guys are made of Originium. With that, extremely less likely to be Oripathy, coz these are Originium.

Idk why yet Hypergryph had this, but I think it should ease the nostalgia for OG Arknights Doctors / Players, **kinda**. Just look at one of these, Ardelia the sheep girl. How heavy it was taking care of Eyja (who had Oripathy & got severe symptoms over there) back then?

## And then for Perkedel?

in Perkedel, Death has a difference. There is tragic death, and privilege death. Tragic death means you died before your supposed lifespan, such as accident, cancer, murder, etc. And the Privileged you guessed it, age ones.  
One shall be proud whenever your loved one has reached their finish lines (2 Tim 4:7), especially because of age, which mean they have done their task in the world, very well. 

*psst But of course God also told us to also grateful for tragic death too, I personally disagree, but digressly..*

Of course, for reason, there are many cases of disagreement. from the necessity of leadership, down to a cuddles. Death is death, and death means loss. No matter how many centuries have passed, where all have taught people the lesson of deaths, so many still.. believe the oversimplification of it. The believe that ommits the true meanings and adds more bias towards the yeah you should figure that out.

And so, DNB had an experiment about this. How about we make the copy paste, like `6th day` film? Like seriously, didn't they watch that film and learn the important lesson in it?!  
How it's done if it's of course different. In fact they learned based on that exact Arknights game, how to **at least record consciousness**, and get best shell anytime whenever possible. That's the key. And when a shell is ready, let's inject, like Avatar 2, clone the Quaritch and reborn him with the existing memory of original him, yeah!! Obviously, we cannot forget to ask consent about it, and these first participants did.

And then what's next? Did this service commercialized?

Thankfully no. And better, the backlashing peers targeted the protest directly towards who disagreed about any death and wanted the clone. So, the project is ultimately canceled, and the age died people will not get cloned in any case. Now, **what to do with these prototypes**? Kill em? **what the fuck is wrong with you man?!** They already lived! Like it was Endfield Reconvener, they're conscious!, have soul! hence full human rights! Well, since you have no moral, how about this:  
These 5 prototypes, each for different elements, **will be available for free, including each duplicates**! yey! Permanent! Once you've finished first quest that unlocks Mail & Exploration, you'll get these all free alongside the original God Hand's rewards like the original Endfield back when it launches 2026. All you have to do, is pick one that suits best with your style, and/or condition, upgrade them.

## Ah

Pls note, The video sauce above tells us Kal'tsit & some others waived to be Assimilated. Gone. But somehow Hypergryph seems to refuse to let their OC *die*, under M3 here in Endfield. *Coincidental* look ye.
