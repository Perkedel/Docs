# Endmin in Latex Suit

Visiting X0p1r4t3 Eenvrnsment New Branch mall. the X0p1r4t3 a century ago built a branch mall in Arenod Sediron, as an experiment.

The mall is inspired from Stella Sora Monoliths.

Now, Endmin has explored so many stuffs going on and did traded with few shops around.

Times up, assemble back.

## Begin

Halluo: Okay, Endmin. Are we done?

Endministrator: Yes, I'm done for today.

Endmin appears to Halluo in bespoke Latex Suit. That thing put Halluo to assundered feeling. To be aroused, and not to show that blush.

Halluo: (losing focus).... (realized) HEAHEHA!... Sorry. Wow. Hymatt's Bespoke, n.. nice.

Endmin: Made of synthesized tree rubber with titanium grid meshing. I've heard it's a family long running business.

Halluo: Yeah, from Dr. Hymatt. He got generations already. eh..

Halluo: Okay.., hear me out. Mmm, considering there will be another group of people who wandered who are.. yeah, that's why people don't show it all up out in the lobby here. You should instead find the dedicated room for it, they got one.

Endmin: Ah!.

Halluo: Yeah, those rooms. Enclosed private gaming rooms, for just 12 Pts. a minute. Would you like to try?

Endmin: Nah, maybe later. ... I've also have ordered (the suits) for all Operators. and yours too.

Halluo: Huh?? What for?

Endmin: I know you collect Latex suits, why not have another? I have surveyed the mission party that the dress code is `Rubber wear`. Yep.

Halluo: (take out phone and reread brief) Oh really?, lemme check..

Yep it is.

Halluo: Huh... (Embarrassed, he prefer not to show off his latex suit fetish in public space) Well just to get the rubber technologies, just once..

Endmin: I also overheard someone's discussion that related to our mission. Dr. Hymatt won't go. They are still wondering why.

Halluo: (suspicous, this is probably therefore a bad feeling) Oh.. wonder why.

Endmin: As usual, bring Gocce. I'll get Perlica. (total 4 Operators team)

Halluo: This had to be careful. Might be a danger. That's not okay.
