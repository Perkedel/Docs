# Ice Cream That Cannot Melt Recklessly

## Begin

A Fancy Restaurant scene

.

.

Kukse: (bring the revolutionary ice cream onto the table) Introducing (put) the Ice Cream that cannot melt by heat.

Lavetain excited

Kukse: Our ancestors made this formula a couple centuries ago. We just modify its chemical composition so it has even more higher melting point, while still taste like Ice Cream. Despite harder to melt, once it reaches your mouth, the point will return to usual. Took us a long time to figure out how to make it react to Ptialin (human spit / saliva chemical name). Try it out

Lavetain try

Lavetain: Mmm, it taste like Ice cream.. ... Does melt.

Kukse: It's made specifically for people like you. Heating aura, where other ice cream melts before you can even ponder upon those.
