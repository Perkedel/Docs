# Improve Labour Phone Factory

Surreal Blender Meme

Endmin & Andre was contracted to a phone factory to help them improve their manufacturing lines.

> [!TIP]
> Surreal people larynx are TTS. Despite sounds very natural and indistinguishable, it is a very developed engine that's been improving over the past few centuries.  
> The choice of this was due to a history of YouTubeized Surreal Meme comics. While it may sounds cheapskate, it defined the **culture** of its own since then.  
> Be advised, to voice act these people, you are **Required to agree to `Voice-Sampling (Sounfont, synthesis)` term (since 5⭐ of 6 Job Tier)**. The system works like one of VOCALOID, UTAU, flite Festvox, espeak, etc.

## Begin

Endmin & Andre arrived.

.

.

Soperek: Endministrator. At last you have arrived. While you are busy, I have hired one of your Enfielder specializing in manufacturing, Andre to help us improve our lines.

Andre: So Endmin. These are the folks I was talking about.

Endministrator: hmmm, (greet that receptionist) Hello, my name in Endministrator.

Soperek: (keep greet) And my name is Soperek. I am the receptionist of this facility. Shall we begin now?

Endmin: Let's go.

### Enter the sandbox field.

The widest flat land area unlike any others. Perfect for building manufacturing lines as many as you like it.

Soperek: Here is our current line. Please observe, the current lines around here.

Yes, the line looks like the ancient ones across our Terra back then. The people over there sat by the conveyor, processing the manufacturings, step by step. There's only few automation machines in some of those processing steps. Considering it for today, it just looks grim no matter what by most new people today.

Soperek: We apologize for grim looking lines. Which is why we invite you, Endfield Industries to help us bring the new lines that not only fully automatic, but also has **dynamic adjustability** that allow us to change certain lines according to our customer demand. Andre, you may now proceed providing the details you have just made to the Endministrator.

Andre: Ah yes, (take out surreal piece of blueprint from pocket) one sec, (pull)!!.....

Endmin suprised, Andre just taking out the paper like it's cartoon. Well, that's Surreal Blender Meme for ya.

Andre: (finish) Ah, (roll out onto invisible table)!.. I have prepared the blueprint for you, so you don't need to scour anywhere else. They know their stuffs, so I advised we used what we've been designed here over the past few weeks.

Soperek: Andre additionally have said that, the core requires your authorization. Therefore we finally invited you, as the beholding key we need to commence this process. May I?

Endmin: (analyzing)..... (done) Okay. Without further ado.

Move to the spot there and interact to authorize AIC in Surreal Blender Meme Realm.

**Badass Cutscene**

duar! plotak! tada here's AIC

Soperek: What a spectacular spectacle. To be honest, we do not need that, but we have been living under boredom over the past few centuries, so I'll take this as an appreciation for your meticulousness. Now, we shall begin applying your `Smarterest Blueprinting` right ahead. Endmin?

Endmin install the auto-blueprint like usual.

Soperek: Alright. Let us examine.

B roll

.

.

.

Soperek: Fascinating. Another spectacle of manufacturing marvel. So, Endmin. Do you have any licensing scheme that we must process every unit of time?

Endmin: (confused) Huh?

Soperek: For example. Application of a certain sets of module, requires us to pay to the beholder of said technologies in order us to be re-granted continued usage.

Andre: Okay, I've also just searched our database, what Soperek said is a ***Subscription Fee***. The user must pay maybe a month, a year, as a license required to use their technologies.

Endmin: HUh? Umm.. That's sounds... predatory.

Andre: Exactly!

Soperek: How much we must give you in exchange so we have the license to be granted of continued use?

Endmin: Uh.. no, it's free.. Isn't this realm also owned by DNB?

Soperek: Correct. In fact automatically, we're all therefore **Overseers**.

Endmin: No, just it as long as you like it, Andre, be sure to provide them the tutorial.

Andre: Yes yes! I also already have done that as well.

Endmin: So yeah. No. It's **Free**.

Soperek: As in Beer? and **Freedom** too?

Endmin: Yeah.

Soperek: Very much appreciated. Cool and good awesome div by zero. Thank you.

Endmin: no problem!

## Advantages

- Widest area size. Square, and widestest of exponent related to 2048s.
- Immediately unlocks all efficiencies, immediately level 11-like development. But you still need to fullfill 3 sub-PAC area levels.
- Unrestricted features. You can mix and match feature facitilies e.g. between Valley IV, Wuling, Arenod Sediron, West Cartesian, so on so forth.
- Exclusive Facility: Busbox. Shapes like the AIC, but has more outputs, and mow even uncompromised corners (corner grids can be used). Each hole switchable between unload from or load into, as simple as defining Arduino Pin modes. 
- Sidebus preunlocked. Avaiable on the Top, Left, and now, also Right & Bottom. Original lines hase been moved somewhere for you, Endministrator!

## Iyey

Herion: At last. I can finally resurrect our modular phone & laptop lines, 5000x more efficient. Yes.
