# Embarrassing River

> [!WARNING]  
> Artist's Bathwater reference

After Halluo, Gocce, Perlica, & Endmin got the lead, they got the location where should go. Well, from here the only fastest way to get there is to ride a boat ride at Embarrasing River.

## Begin

Embarrasing River, Mudik City. Basically an Underground system. Complete with LED hybrid fake sky opening made of Sun redirector pipe optic.

Halluo: Okay, here it is. The Embarrasing River ride.

Perlica: In... sewer??

Halluo: Ooh-yes. In the drainage system. Don't worry, all our drainage filter works way too well, so well, the water here is very clean, clear, and transparent. as beautiful as those Ray Tracing demos & benchmarks at Surreal Blender Meme realm. Want some more? Over there somewhere at the end, another filter. Moleculars included, so it's like those waters gets to *reincarnate*, reborn!, back to drinkable water sort of or uh.. plant waters! yeah. We recycle 💩 shit.

Perlice: ...

Halluo: Ah, sorry about the poop.

Arrived. There's the boat ride.

Halluo: Alright, uh.. get in.

Gocce, Perlica, and Endmin get in there in advance.

Halluo keeps pace and get in last. In back seat, because there is ***`coin slot`***.

Halluo scan the QR with DNB ID. This is how to pay in DNB, like QRIS. Same, EMV on QR.

Halluo type pin to confirm. Transaction complete. The boat immediately starts moving automatically.

Deltarune song, Acid River of Love!

Halluo: Alright, full speed ahead.

The boat is slow tho

Perlica: Have you analyzed had we go through with car?

Gocce: 2 hours. We must pass through ups and downs, left and right turns. Also many houses that are all shacks that selss snacks, drinks, and stuffs, causing jams because everyone parked on each. Here, 10 minutes. Cos the path is very straight & a right keepturn.

Perlica: (pointing out the ceiling sky hole) I thought there is that sky there.., but looks like you used fibre optic (because the glass there is diffused to spread the photon)?

Gocce: Correct. Above us is thick amount of rocks. We drilled through the pipe to bring the sun light to here. at night, there's the emulator LED, usually set to moon, if it's (the actual moon) covered up.

Perlica: I see...

Halluo: Okay, 5 metres in. Look on your port side (left). There'll be a diorama, just a sec..

Secret wall left there slides up

Halluo: There it is. .. Nothing special btw, but.. some achievement representing artifacts.. just look at a glance

The First ever Family Room OLED TV without HDMI port at all, instead, DisplayPorts. And still has RCA jacks, because it's also an FPGA upscaler all in one.

HT protocol that can connect cross realms, even if in between there's a vortex that broke Areluid & Rumanod nomad ship. It's also supports bidirectional communication like audio video call usually.

statue of Kaorfa. Tribute statue. It's a stone Protogen statue. Joel Robert Justiawan was the first ever Kaorfa that ruled Perkedel Cinematic Universe.

Build PC Micro. Rakit PC but smartphone. Inspired from Fairphone & Framework.

Orbs decoration of Twins Saga. Kaorfa realized Arona & Plana each to a new body. Now we have Momoi & Midori, Arona & Plana, and Arisu & Kei.

Miniature decoration of Cartesian orbs. Arenod Sediron with DNB successful in conquering realms before the evil ones took place. This was a permanent wish from Duron Sediron, the first king of Areluid, Rumanod, and Sediron unification.

The 2 Crowns replicas. King's crown Representing Duron the King, & Queen's crown, representing his wife, Chalar the Queen. The coronation that reunited Areluid & Rumanod, thanks to the Sedirons.

Endmin: Wow. There's so many history documented here.

Halluo: Indeed. Our journey just started a centure ago, but we've already adventured alot!. Yeah.

🫀 Cardio Procreation. Made up Heart organ. The infamous innovation brought by Duron Sediron in collaboration with Areluid that time during his internship at Areluid (now Arenod Sediron) realm.

Halluo: Ah, the Classic one, Heart organ!, & look it's beating. Don't worry, that's made up heart, not rip out of someone, that one is Graphene fibre btw.

Perlica: What to do with that?

Halluo: Uhh you know, Transplant e.g., .., you lost 50-50 and get broken heart organ (jantung lemah), and you can buy the new quality heart affordable and often available at all time, stuff like that. But these days, we got alot of these made, too easy these days, some of them made into a toy for uh.... Dang!, mouth again, talking about cardiophilia fetish again haha..

Perlica: (Embarrased blush) Hehe...

<!--oh yeah I forgot to warn you about Embarrasign signage-->

.

.

.

Passed the artifact section, the secret wall slides down. sail continues

Halluo: Ah. Okay. Looks good to me. Look, over there, 4 metres from now, the right turn will get us there. Just be patient. won't be long, enjoy the sound.., you'll never hear this again anywhere else that's not DNB.. ..

.

.

.

Halluo suddenly reminded, in 2.5 meters a signage over the top. That's the Embarraser reaction box LED display.

Halluo: Oh shit, yeah! uhm..

Perlica & Endmin start paying attention

Halluo: Look at that LED display there.. Thats' reaction box. Embarrasers like to say lots of embarrasing things, but no need to worry, only say it here, no spread. So pls.. do not insult them for it, that's what they do.., basically we read mind each other all times, and uh.. yeah basically it. So prepare up, the Embarrasers gonna say the *fortune* to us, here we go..

Appear on LED screen!

> During your stay here, you, Ms. Endministrator, have shed about 20.4 grams of Originium in total into our drainage system. 

Halluo: Ouw..

> Of the 5 months of stays.  

> Because of you, Filter maintenance frequency has been increased. But thanks to Mrs. Yorin, we've enginered the patch quickly and things have returned to normal.

Endmin: (Ultiamate Embarrassed) Uh...

> Worry not at all. Nobody even us want your Wastewater. Ew.

Endmin: (Endmin's Bathwater & Pisswater?!) HUH?? (reddest Blushed)!!!!!!

Halluo: Well that's uh... Embarrassers for ya... yea..... umm.. I apologize on their behalf.

Endmin: I.. showered on your place too.... and used toilet too...

Halluo: It's okay, that's how humanoid it is generally. ha...m. Well, let's keep waiting. We got a mission

.

.

.

.

Halluo: Okay, finally,

another secret all on left slides up. Baricaded observation of Filter whirlpool. The scene was quiet, until this door opens up. 

Halluo: (louder) This is where it all be fetched. The water will be filtered once more, remolecularized, into a brand new water. It'll be usable as outer water, and some further processed again to be drinkable. (oh no, do not let drink bathwater said)... oh shit, just experimental still tho, ... yeah basically it.

door slide down, and the scene quiets again.

keep right. passing the bends of riverway.

Halluo: (normal volume) Okay, we're going to arrive... And uh.. We are very sorry about that. We are so weird freaks.. pls forgive us... let's not remember about anything you saw, if you don't want to memorize. Thancc. Okay uh...

Auto parks. Boat parks by port side

Halluo: Aand off we go! (jump off Port side first)!, (offer assistance hand) iyeah..

pull Perlica, then Endmin, and Gocce

Halluo: Okay, This way.

## End

Pls avoid making cutscene or dialog about seeing recycled drinkable water on store shelves. I don't think this is appropriate atm. If they ask the canon, no, Recycled Drink water is outlawed immediately after the experiment that time. The drinkability works btw, but still no. Now it's just for botanical purpose.
