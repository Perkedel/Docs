# Frutiger Endfield?!

Frutiger in Endfield?? Why not!

## Begin

Endmin & friends have arrived. After few weeks the renovation in the Capsule, Sophia made the ship feels like Frutiger. It's shiny, glass, candy, so intriguing and aqua that [you'd want to lick it](https://youtu.be/IjmJU29OxX8).

Sophia Doohickey: Endmin! Endmin! you're here again! Welcome.., Oh! You brought friends too, yay!

Endministrator: Hello again. (impressed with architectures now) Wow, Sophia. You sees to have.., a *taste*

Sophia: Mmh, Mmh! Yeah, I call this, Candy! Coz it's looks like it, very sweet!

Endmin: ... Okay, I like this one.

Sophia: YAAY!!, Come, lemme show you around. (saw Chen is licking the decor candy) Uh.., Chen?

Chen Qianyu: (licking), (just received)?!?!, (realization & tidy up)askldfjaio!!!!, Whoops!, ehe.. Ahem!.. Sorry.

Sophia: It's okay. Lots of Operators I brought here wanna lick it. Also that's a fake candy. Don't eat it.

Chen: (disappointed) Oh..

Sophia: Don't worry, We have candies too down in the canteen. C'mon, let me show you around.

Follow Sophia showing around the facility. You'll be introduced the same amount of facilities as you have in OMV Dijiang, and how the placements are different.
