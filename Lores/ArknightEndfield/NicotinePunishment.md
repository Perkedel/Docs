# Nicotine Punishment

Oripathy contracts Perkedel's people too?! How?!?!?

> [!TIP]
> Previously told, Oripathy only happens to Hypergryph people in any of the universe HG belonged there.

## Begin

Dr. Galah rushed onto Mudik Science Center lobby and stoppes there. Pinged Halluo to come here right immediately now.

Galah Ruslehan: Halluo!! This is bad!!!

Halluo: (walk calmly) Hey, girl.. what's with the panik running?

Galah: Oripathy..., on our people, in this universe!!

🔊💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀

Halluo: (giant concern internally) What?.

Galah: I cannot come into your place either, but I'll give you diagnosis now., (just show upfront don't give) read!

Halluo telepathy commanded everyone in the science residence inside to stay inside. Then read the diagnosis.  
Something piqued interest is that while luckily he is not from any of DNB realm, **the man is a heavy vaper**.

Halluo: Huh. Vaper. We DNB loathe smoking, not to mention Vaping. No difference. Forgive my.. racist bluntness but... do you have anyone else there also?

Galah: You mean to scan other smoker and controls for Oripathy risk?

Halluo: Ehhh... 

Galah: Don't worry, We have another patients who wants to (cannot lightly say `commit suicide`).... you know..

Halluo: 🤨?

Then suddenly a head prison division from Judgement realm rushed into the scene.

Cujah: Mr. Halluo! Ugh, this is fucking horror, man!

Halluo: What? did tried Originium stuffs also?

Cujah: It was from our Juvenile Detention class!.. Ugh.. I was just giving the Students tour of Orignium Museum and then... It happened?

Halluo: If I'm not mistaken, some of thr class were punished into Detention Special School for smoking or at least vaped, right?

Cujah: (Halluo remembered) Huh? Yes! we have those sent in for that! (Hypothesis sparked) Wait.

Halluo: Forgive for my rash presumption. Already 27 months we've interacted, we did not get any. Oripathy only happens if Originium works, which only on Hypergryph. People come here and there, never registered DNB just visiting. They did something to Originium. We've been glazing it over since we don't get it, and we cured those who are into Orisync. Some Orisynced even.. zero Originium now, Believe it or Not.. whoops trademark 😅 haha.. Anyways..... I might've glazed the vapers and smokers visitors lately. We don't survey customers about that lately, only for the rides to be. huuuuh...

Galah: And btw that's exactly what some of our patients have said!

Halluo: Ugh, cruel experiment time again?

### A few Cancelworthy experiments later.

Yep. Vaper and Smoker will get harsh debuff against the risk of Originium. Orisync will fail if you don't stop smoking or vaping at least by 2 years.  
Suppresant effect will also significantly reduced during this debuff window.

Halluo: I don't fucking know how world works.

Koros Gibb: I mean.. Smoking or Vape bad.. This honestly... over (prevent `kill`)... Argh nvm. No comment. I hate smoking. we don't smoke.

Galah: Btw, I just found alcoholics patients at random who happened to be your visitors also. Nothing at all.

Halluo: Ah, good to know. But that does not!- justify

cut off
