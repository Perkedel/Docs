# Kept Missed for the Dodge & Parry

The hard combat has been done. but Koros was the most wounded of all 4 Operators in Battle.

## Begin

Koros: Sss...,

Perlica is tending torso wounds. swipe wounds with betadine wetted cotton.

Koros: AAAW SAKIT SAKIT SAKIT SAKIT

Halluo: Hang in there, Koros. Just for a while..

Koros: Jesus Christ, That's Betadine I told you, right?

Perlica: Yes.

swiping with betadine on wound should not be this painful. But those Aggeloi Æther stones seems to have increased the pain.

Koros: Ugh, expected. Sss. Gargh, if only **I had a technology to cue me dodge, parry** ..., none of this would happen!. Ugh!.., Sss, Argh.. Jesus Christ!..

## End
