# Why No Parry

There are 2 types of enemy about to big attack. in Endfield New Paradigm, we have changed the indicators a bit to make it similar to ZZZ.

- Red cling. You must dodge
- Gold cling (formerly circle charge up). Use your skill or combo or ultimate to parry

## Begin

The enemy is too strong. all 3 Operators HP is ultra low rn.

confused

Cleanser: There. Don't stand up, lemme finish you. (charge sword one last time)

Red Cling

Endmin has been badly wounded and also can no longer stand up

Koros Gibb: Oh shit I'm done.

Suddenly Matrix enter the scene

PANG!!!!!!!!!!!

Matrix Gibb: Ugh! Seriously, did you forgot how to parry?

Matrix Gibb is Defender

Koros: Cousin!!!... Uhh.., skill out. all wounded.

Matrix: Pathetic! Why is combat dependent on parameters like this, whyn't all can parry?! (share Jincao drinks, throw 3) here drink these!

all 3 caught and consume immediately. Stand up & continue to battle

Matrix: My parry can cause Vulnerable. After that, you, Crit. Keep stacking it, got it?

then those 4 operators continued fighting and won.

Matrix handcuffed Cleanser

Cleanser: Ugh. I'll concede this time. You'll get yours next time, JUST YOU WAIT!.

Matrix: Shut up, better get Lawyer we got before you spoke wrong (you have right to remain silent and lawyer will be provided for you). (push impolitely) Get in!.

Cleanser locked onto the wagon. wagon go to Judgement Realm.

## End
