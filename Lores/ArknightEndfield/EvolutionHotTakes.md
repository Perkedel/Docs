## Begin

Let's take Indonesia & China together.

When Indonesia was colonialized, I can assume the reason that we are what we are now, is because the VOC is an exclusivist. Education only available to their own people, the nobles of Dutch. You can hear why there's R.A. Kartini, Ki Hajar Dewantara, and many others who fought for Indonesia's independence.  
Alas tho, now that we're free, idk why, but why our SDM is garbage lately? There's alot of complex things around, probably isn't just to do with above colonialism anymore at this point. We just... want to act recklessly whatever it is, unbound to restrictions. Me? No, I don't like to disrespect anyone's facilities. That's on them. I prefer to pocket the trash until I can find one.

Idk also how about China. Many China mudders told us that these naughty people ruined lots of places, even their own land, the same and similar cases of probably because of low educations too whatever the reason was.  
But then, about 2024s, China has developed at a rapid speed. Feel free to include the predatorism they did with other developing countries (such as Trash ODM, Huge debt projects, etc.), I'm no longer Chinese, but beware of other glazers there. With it, also the people have realized to behave. Cities clean, nothing gets broken, if it is then fixed asap, etc. Do I care if the mudders gone mad & then forced to lie? hmm, I guess no. China is now even better, 180 degrees opposite of what the mudders told us! At this point, Not only forced to ODM (platinum or muck) if there's no such, but also the brand itself too as well! DJI, Skyworth, Huawei, Xiaomi, Hisense (acquired Toshiba Display), anything. Arknight's from China, ZZZ's from China. They're good games, and Chinese games have varying Gacha qualities too. No longer we're tied to Japanese ones like we used to, coz many Chinese games are now also fucking 3D Locomotions!!  
Especially Endfield we're right now, oh man! Lots of hackery Hypergryph did with Unity Enterprise Source Code. This is no longer just about baked lighting anymore, no, there's more going on!

So, do you want to start to behave, and accept to be taught? If you're ready, then pls help me so I'm not alone.
