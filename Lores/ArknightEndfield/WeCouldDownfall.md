# We Could Downfall

## Begin

Perex the butler delivered the item to Matrix Gibb. Matrix is cousin, son of Poberes Gibb (Lukro's younger brother)

Perex: Here is your, Reference, my lord.

Matrix Gibb: (while unboxing) Apreciated, Hehh. Even tho I concede defeat (to China), I, Matrix, always be, and will be, keep insulting China. China, will always be, and is always be, ... inferior.

Koros : Dad, should we monitor him?

Lukro: Let him. Gibb, never monitor insults of each others Gibb.

Koros: Pls forgive me dad, I feel different this time. This could lead to DNB's unexpected downfall, only because of him. Did he say something outloud recently?

Gocce: So far.... no, he only did it once, but never anymore lately. Which mean he's not stupid, he aware of the consequences.

The 360 action camera has been unboxed

Matrix: (stare)......, Prepare me the **Throwaway account**.

Insta360 too requires login

Perex: Your wish is my command, my lord. (open up password manager & build login template)...

## Oops

Perex: My lord. My apologies. It seems Insta360 has been EOS. I was unable to connect even to their service.

Matrix: (snatch the tablet) WHAT?-(examine)........ Fuck. There you go. Ancient Artifact that had it like this will always broke by the time I came to this world. Ugh.. fuck yoou...., C-

Gocce: (composed panik) My lord, sorry for interuption. Not all China companies. We had ever Overseers there too. You're just holding a non-Overseen artifact.

Perex: Next artifact, Van Elektronische's Contracted Manufactures. From 2051, Action Camera.

There's that `Made in China` label there.

Matrix: Oh really! We did Oversaw the enemy base too? (take box) Anyways, (unbox)...

Now this one does not require login. The quality is also competitive with others as well. At that time, Indonesia is under SDM crisis. So the remote manufacturer for Earth / Perkedel's Terra has to be moved out to China temporarily.
