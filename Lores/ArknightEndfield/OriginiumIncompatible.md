# Originium Incompatible

Halluo is an Inspector at Overseer, and Gocce is the Supervisor. They wanted to see how Endmin combat right ahead during this mudik.

Unexpectedly, things gone wrong when suddenly her power is gone here

<!-- Originium only works on Hypergryph's assimilated universes. Some change scene will involve DNA warp instead of portaling to prevent contamination -->

## Pre

Yorin & Endmin is still at the basement in West Cartesian Bikini Sesuatu house.

Halluo: 10 hours!.., Wow, they seems had fun, but we gotta go home., (call Yorin)....

Yorin's HT rang, then Halluo spoke in advance. dismiss the ringtone by pressing PTT, Hold PTT to unmute & answer the call immediately, release to mute.

Halluo: (PTT) Brik Brik!

Yorin Kumandang: HEAUAHGAH!!, (Take HT), (PTT) Roger Roger, Yorin..

Halluo: Hey, sorry causing your heart organ jump bouncing around like breakout arkanoid, uh.. you've been in there for so long, but it's already night both here and Mudik city. Different world, coincidental alignment.

Yorin: (PTT) UH.. uh-hehehehe... I.. we are in Experimental Realm right now. (Rel)

Halluo: (PTT) Experimental?!?!, uh-... your office space? (Rel)

Yorin: (PTT) Huh. (Rel)

Halluo: (flabbergasted) Oh... Wow, I'm.. suprised. You usually never brought any guest at all to your co-working space.

Yorin: HAH? Really?!, (blushed embarrased) Oooooh.... (PTT) Hello? Uh.. thanks for mentioning that.., I didn't know.. (rel) 

Halluo: (PTT) No need to be embarrased, but if you're done, pls go back to Mudik city promptly. (Rel)

Yorin: (PTT) Yes yes, don't worry. I'll make sure Endmin is safe. (rel)

Halluo: (PTT) Okay I think that's all. Me & Gocce will be on Mudik city. Tell Endmin okay, Great luck & GBU, over and out (rel)., (close call).

Yorin: Bye.. Hoof...

Endministrator: Anything else?

Yorin: Uhm.. I think that's all. Feel free to explore around, and once you're done, use the jump warp there.

Explore around! Find treasures around this Experimental office scene.

## Begin

The next day.

Gladiator arena, Mudik Science Center

Endmin called, go to combat backyard inside the Mudik Science Center. Overseer inspection coming up.

Endmin come onto the arena. Operators sat around the circling seats. Halluo & Gocce observe from the commentary deck up there.

Endministrator: Morning, everyone. What is that dummy provided there?

Halluo: (toggle PTT) Hi, Endmin. So, today's inspection day. So, everyone we invited here will be tested for stuffs. Like this combat.

Endmin is curious, lock in.

Halluo: So, to further introduce ourselves, I, Halluo, am the Inspector at Overseer. Gocce here is the Supervisor, like Perlica of yours.

Endmin: I see..

Halluo: Now, I decided to give the first honor to you, Endministrator. All you have to do, is fight that dummy, simple. And Operators, pay attention.

Operators around the circling seats locked in.

Halluo: (Untoggle PTT mute), (open window), (shout without microphone, ala Rome) Recording start!!, begin anytime., (close window)

Endmin building focus.

.

.

Fight!

Slash slash slash, FINISH (Originium failed to pops up)!

Operators confused, her finisher failed to work.

Halluo internal awkward

unheard cricket feeling

.

.

Endmin try again. Slash slash slash, Finish! Wtf, did not work? Finish! huh?!?! Fin... ish???

Halluo: (toggle PTT) Guys, guys, guys... Uh.. something went wrong, We apologize for inconveniences, this is not usually happened, trust me, ask Operators guest I brought you guys, (Untoggle PTT mute) (self whisper) Shit!!., (rush down to arena)!!!!.....

Gocce start analyzing.

Endmin: No.., (try to activate originium (vein on your hands))!!!!!!

Halluo: Endmin!, Endmin!!.. .... ..., (arrived) Hhh, hhh, hhh, you okay? Pls, don't force it. We dont' know something went wrong. Come with us, to the locker.

### Gladiator Locker room

All Operators & the Endministrator were put to break time. Gocce has analyzed the situation and the conclusion is about to be given.

Halluo walk left and right-forth contemplating worryingly.

.

.

Halluo: Ugh.., Gocce?

Gocce: I got it. It seems some element that these Operators & the Endmin posses, .. does not work nor activate in this world here.

Halluo: Next?

Gocce: My hypothesis, Originium only works in Hypergryph's assimilated universe. All to world of Arknight. If they brought here, Originium becomes.. just a *plastic crystal*.

Halluo: Huh..

Gocce: Well.., People that's based on Orignium like Endmin turns into *regular human*. At the same time, the infected can be peaceful for now, coz no activity of Originium. Though, if.. the level of infection is acute.. may could kill them, coz part of their DNA have already assimilated over 50%. It's like eating DNA destroying poisonous mushroom. You'll be okay for few days, but that next, plekk!!

Halluo: Interesting... Wait a minute. We've been here 5 months already! Endmin could die the next hour or so, coz she's THE, Originium!.

Gocce: it's Gacha based. Just hypothesis, remember not to spread fear.

Halluo: Yeah.. Things gone complicated it seems. Ah, and the other hand,

Gocce: If we brough OUR, people to Hypergryph's.., It has zero chance of Oripathy.

Halluo: Okay, test it out with prisoners, most criminal ones who gets death sentence or what.. mine Originium..

Gocce: Hmm.., cruel, but tryable. It's like... Trickal people, exposed to mercury from Vivi, no, other other other Vivi, the dragon thyren. Only simple cold flu, masuk angin..., until Vivi removed from scene, and administered special potion to supress the poison effects of mercury.

Halluo: While it succs nobody of us can benefit, and Endmin's stuffs malfunctions here, at least we won't at the same time receive the consequences of of it. Now, what do we do?

.

.

Gocce: I'll bring them back to hotel, and you.. do whatever you want you just said. Then, invite Yorin to do some experiments about Originium at Experimental Universe, thank God we got Yorin trusted her. I want everyone who got infected converted to stabilized. **Orisync**. Be like Endmin.

Halluo: Cool! Okay, let's do it.

Gocce: Endministrator, Operators, We shall return back to the hotel room. We found an interesting analysis. Originium does not work here, Maybe just back in your home. I recommend you take a rest while we are discussing the follow ups.

Stella Sora Movie Maker Transition

## Prison Experiment

Halluo has sent the proposal to the Judgement.

Oxtree: (read)..., This, is interesting. And very cruel

Halluo: I know but.. this mission is to test if Oripathy can gets contact to these criminal scums from our universe!

Oxtree: Well, I guess it's lucky time.-..

The Judgement held lottery exclusive to unexecuted death sentence criminals. Some Clouters won, so those thousands in total will go to Arknights: Endfield to mine Originium, temporarily replacing the original miners. Now the miners can take a break and detox from the Originium to reduce Oripathy chances.

## Originium Trials

Another day, in the Experimental Realm. Yorin & Endmin tried to bring some Originium related tests to engineer the converter. This to make a cure to Oripathy, converting it to Orisync, as similar to Endministrator. Like Yunkui Summit's techniques of controlling Ether & its waste, Miasma.

Endmin put the **Originium crystal sample into the analysis chamber**. Jar wraps the sample tight, concealed in glass. Lmao reference, but don't worry, no Resonance Cascade, but the `3`.

Endmin enters the Experimental Chamber. The chamber is fully white and shaded. Sky is just bare white, and the ground is like Blender plane. Door slides up, enter, door closes down.

Yorin: Okay, Endmin, ready anytime.

Endmin: (deep breath in)!!!....., (exhale politely) Hooof.........., (vein in hand)!!!, (manifest the Originium Power Tower just like the sign up level)!!!!

The Tower erects high, to the white air. The Hypergryph emulator indeed works well.

Yorin: Okay! We're good. Here's the list of the stuffs

AIC. Endmin tries to spawn regular AIC system in the scene. The machines works normally. Invite the Automation Core to the scene like meteor, whoosh! It landed and now the core is here. Try blueprint. The production works well.

Living Beings. Endmin spawn many originium tree. The sprout grew well. Endmin also spawned few Originium creatures, to see if full crystal being only able to alive with the working of Originium. Yorin then disable the Analysis Chamber. And that's right, after that, All Originium fails, Endmin lost her power, and the creatures crumbles like stones fell scattered. Enable again. The Creature alives again, Originium stuffs worked again, and Endmin gets her power back.

Finally, the Conversion. Yorin spawns an unstable Originium complex. Made of cells used to make Made-up Heart Organs, mixed with Originium. The cube assimilates, simulating Oripathy. The Originium is eating the DNA of the cells tissue fast. There are 4 cubes. 3 controls that is an Orignium cube, and Just cells tissue cube, and Oripathy cube intentionally untreated. Now this one will be treated. Endmin used her might to stabilize the Orignium. Now, the cube turned into Endfield Essence. Basically, now the Originium becomes stabilized, and the cell considers it no longer foreign, Originium no longer becomes selfish, DNA interpreter will be careful about it and makes lesser mistake when replicating. It's no longer Oripathy. It is now **Orisync**. As similar as Endministrator. Success! **We found the cure**.. sort of.

## Result of the crime experiments

***A few Originiumings later***

a month passed. Back again at the Judgement. Here, at the Central Crossban building at Judgement Realm.

Halluo comes solo, via Duet Night Abyss warping, Meteor strike, Juar!!!, stand up.

Oxtree: Ah, Inspector Halluo! Here it is!

Halluo: Is it done?

Oxtree: Yeah! (rush down the wide front stair carefully) This is very surprising! What hyptothesized by Supervisor Gocce & you, flabbergasted me!., Heah h h h, (give paper) take a look!..

Halluo: (take & read)!, (read).....

These are medical check up papers. Only given few tens, but all of them in the sleeve envelope, **shows no Oripathy**. They also brought back some of the new miners from Hypergryph to mine together. **Only some Hypergryph people got oripathy, some those who already got worse and stopped immediately**, and **still zero on Perkedel's**. This beyond science could explain.

Halluo: ... My God.... .... Idk how world works.

## Closing

Now the cure has been found, the next step is application. But of course, we do not know if this would work. So, just few Operators volunteered. **All of them turned Orisync and no longer rely on Suppresants**. But just in case, they are still recommended to administer themselves one regularly. Also that's it, they are still afraid of chances of failsync. Maybe later. We'll see.
