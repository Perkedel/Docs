# Double Blunder

both options are blunder, nothing else. idk anymore what to pick

## Begin

after the Great Consequence in 2070, DNB reputation to outside world has been ruined. So many factors have caused it, from selfish partners expectations, down to sanity deficiency that causes Peers to chose wrongly and upset the partners.

We still had Partner UP. And so, the Peer from DNB is requesting once more for replacement Partner

2071

Jon Oreano: We deeply send our condolences to you. So, Mr. Lukro, as the representative for DNB, looking for new Partner. Is that correct?

Lukro Gibb: Yes!. .. It's expected to see it like this. But also disappointing with much, I truly wish this never happened.

Jon: Before we can commence on, there one thing that... disappointed us

Lukro: Excuse me, what is it?

Jon: I shall be direct, per transparency order. Have you been using assistive text prediction in your IDE, built in or not?

Lukro: Yea, what's wrong?

Jon: (yep, they DNB are pro AI afterall) (breath in)!!!, (sigh) uuuugh.... Mr. Lukro, we apologize that we are no longer interested in your further partnership with Parter UP and affiliafes due to your continued infraction in your work ethics. I'm sorry.

everyone noisy

Lukro: WhAT?!, What do you mean? We forbid use LLM!

Grant Oreano: It's same. AI is AI. wants it LLM or not. You should never even use those text editor that implemented AI in any case.

Lukro: HUH? What do I use then, Vim? C'mon, some codes can only be repeated with no logics available!.. What are you doing?

Grant: SHUT UP!! Clanker supporter don't get to choose. You're out, never come back

Lukro out of option. They seem refuse to be invited to tolerance (diajak kompromi)

laughter of shaming

Lukro: ... That's it. So this is how you've become.? We downtook the last rebooted Harrassers together. You guys been based for long. I supported you you help me each other. And then once they're no more you've lost your purpose.

.

Lukro: hh.., And is this your next endeavour?, becoming **Grift Arbiter**?! .. .. (tearjerk heartbreak) hhh... .. you're the last one I want you betray us.. as a matter of the fact, I tried to glaze over one of your other long time partner invited a Corruptor's descendant onto their partnership, you okay with it, coz I believed you should've processed its prosecutions already, but now what?! That guy's among us! HaaH?!?!

continued gossip here and there

Lukro: The X0p1r4t3's were right!, you're just... Grift Arbiter after all. And fun fact, I never hear tech related stuffs from you guys lately. Zero! But all callout docs! Where's the other?!

.

You should leave this messed up party now

Lukro: I don't get it anymore. All options are blunder. I chose not to hate speech for Prediction users. We never burn bridge. We used it (Zed editor) coz it's usable and fast. But you ask me to death threat those who most not even into unauthorized sampling in 1st place? .. ..

Lukro leave scene
