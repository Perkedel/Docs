# To this day stull Oripathy

## Begin

Halluo: **To this day still Oripathy?!** ..., Jeesus!.. .. .., Doktah!, wha happen? (but that was long ago, of course he already rest in peace) .... argh.. But you guys already have commonized suppresant, & is effective.?

Endministrator: Correct.

Halluo: Hrm. ... That reminds me. My greater Grandpa's story he used to told us when we family were in school. A century ago, my elders used to tend a pack of friends. Basically, we call that a `Hollow` disaster. Same like Originium, `Ether`.., is a magical material that is also as versatile & powerful. But.., it also had a similar risk. You can also be infected, when it's out of control, and instead of dying, you turned into some kind of zombie, elders called it.. `Ethereals`. Long story short only way is now that your corpse is basically eaten, and gone devoured by it. Scarier stuffs. Huh, talked about it, I now really wondered., .., so similar. ..

Endmin: If I'm not mistaken, based from the memories I've recovered so far, The project Originium did started that century ago. Mining such material indeed comes with a risk of ingestion and infection. That's why there was a company called `Rhodes Island`. In it, run by a man who called himself `Doktah` (Doctor).

Halluo: Hmmm, I see. ... Wow, My apologies, even tho we never been into your world that time, Perhaps.. a *fate* sets destiny to us, that I can strongly relate to this together, thanks to said old Commission legends ago. But hey, at least at some point, FInally, the people found workaround. To control amounts of Ether, and crazily, even its waste variants of it, called `Miasma`. We also did.. turned things around, Upgrading `Ether Aptitude` as best as ones can. Using various techniques: Medicals, to Magics & Wizardry. And so, some point of yours, you did have your workaround.

Endmin: Correct. Doktah and fellow operators both in the time and about recently finally found Suppresant at certain point in time. Perspectively, it's now like having a simple flu and *drink the medicine* at this point.

Halluo: Except despite simple, like `Ether coruption` it can't be removed entirely either..

Endmin: Yes.

Halluo: Hm.

Endmin wants to expand factory method to here as well.

Juduo (Halluo's dad): ..., Looking at your proposal, ... Ms. Endmin. While it's fascinating idea, provides minimal consequences while providing great outputs and very versatile, beside the Originium stuffs, We.. do not ever thought of Originium here. And.. we cannot afford any risk from importing & resynthesizing Originium (like off-country Licensed manufacturing) with this idea. But, If you can help us build the same methodology of yours, that is, BASed on our powering technologies, we will gladly approve this.

Halluo: Wow, Called it, no offense tho. I also like your factory methodology. But again, it takes considerable amount of time to invest just to minimize the risk of either the Ether or Originium to power up those factories. Well, I can help you. You should learn about.., Lithium Bricks. I know, it's very traditional, did have risk, but for this one we managed to minimize the risk, by changing the method to make one, Simple, make it solid like brick. My Elders used to call these `Solid Lithium Supercapacitors`. And to charge it, just benefit the radiating lights around us, Solar Panel. Yeah, that's all I know.

Endmin: Any other ideas?

Halluo: Ideas..?..?, Uh.. We did also.. tried ☢️ Fission Decay. That is.. this material that's atomically unstable, and so it.. radiates the neutron so much. Very hot, the *hot* can be fetched somehow with the receiver, it converts to energy. ... Tho turns out that it's its own's a risk. .., In perspective of Daily Life, we already relied on these portable Battery technologies since centuries. The scientists around us here already been improving those techs over the past few centuries too. So, I recommend you stick to our traditional methods of empowerments. What do you say?

Endmin: Very well. Why not try? I would like to oversee the output.

Halluo: That's the spirit!. Let's go.

And so Endmin together with Arenod Sediron designed the factory system designed for Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Arenod Sediron uncovered few archives relating to portable factory system. Indeed, they were tried. But it was too expensive and inefficient. One file said that only the West Cartesian had ahold of it the longest time, while others switched back to traditional methods. Thanks to Endmin's methodology, the Arenod Sediron's attempt gets perfecting makeovers, at last.
