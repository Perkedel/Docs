# Wrong Died World

Endmin gibbed. There was level 10k enemies. She blew the whole arena, coz she thinks they are doing nonsense so why not end it all, tired & bored.

## Begin

Endmin awaken in another world.

Stella Sora death world music. dateTime null. This is a world where the Tyrant woke up when he/she died.

Endministrator: ..., urhm (wake up)....., (open eyes)..., huh?

Endmin woke up in a white room & saw a stone gate.

Virigia: (tap Endmin's shoulder)! ! !-?, Excuse me?

Endmin: (surprised) HUH (look towards pat source)!!?

Virigia: May I ask, who are you?

Endmin: I'm... Endmin?

Virigia: (scanned her name, name's Joel but not the handsome Tyrant) Weird.. Why are you... cute suddenly? Didn't know Tyrant now possessed a new power..

Endmin: Huh??, I'm sorry, you must've been mistaken.

Virigia: Hmm?

Endmin: I don't even know who you are.

Virigia: Wait a minute, (rescan thoroughly)............................................., (yep, that's no Tyrant, but an equivalently powerful species) Oh. Forgive me.

Endmin: It's okay. (yes this is White Room, but).., What is that?

Virigia: That's an exit gate. You have been died so let us take care of you.

Endmin: Uhmm no thanks. I must return.

Bernina: Hmm? How about you take some rest. I know the days have been rough to you lately.

Endmin: I've been used it, (left hand with Originium bracelet command the gate to open)!!..

Both Virigia & Bernina flabbergasted as Endmin opened the gate without Vita

Endmin rushes panikly towards the gate

Endmin left the scene

.

.

.

Bernina: (softly) What was just that?!...

Virigia: I think I need some cups of tea..

Bernina: Do we still have Tyrant's contact?

Virigia: Still do. I'll send him the Heartlink (SMS) later.

### OMV Dijiang

Endmin returned to real world.

Endmin: (wake up open eyes) Uuurrrgh....

Halluo: (noticed)?!, Endmin!!-(rushed to Endmin's bed)!!!!!!!, Endmin!, You okay?,

Endmin: Um..

Halluo: (take out phone) Here, fsck first! (start scan her)!

phone scan her brain. `fsck` is File System Check. It's a `chkdsk` for POSIX.

.

Brain integrity 100%, no Amnesia found!

Halluo: Huoh!, (hug tightly ala culture of South Americas) Thank God!..

Gocce: Halluo, found intel.

Halluo: Okeh.., Uh.. What's your label?

Endmin: `JOELwindows7`.

Halluo: Okeh good good good. Ugh.. Jesus Christ! I didn't expect we had to ward off that.. **Harrasser** just now. Don't worry, Your friends fine, see

All of them too has been ungibbed

Halluo: No limbs gone. Wow, yours thrown 200 meters across, but don't worry, our resurrector can find them, and weld them back to you, test the motors

Endmind tries to move her hands and legs.

.

100% motoric integrity

Halluo: Good good good. Okay Gocce, now. How the fuck did the Harrassers here?!., I thought it was supposed to be an extinct Legend raging back in 2025 to 2100.

Gocce: They're from Vivi's offsprings. The other branch tho, no our acquired ones. From 1st level by her womb.

Halluo: Huh? I thought Vivi (Final boss of Homestuck Interpol) was supposedly had 2 kids (all brothers). What's going on?

Gocce: The latter ones became **Invaders** advisor, in 2100s. Then today, Harrassers popping up from him.

Halluo: ..... fuck.

.

.

Halluo: I don't want to fault anyone here, I hate it. But.., What did happened during the care in Vivi's perma-arrest at Judgement. So,

Gocce: After she was defeated by Vriska & Tavros, Vivi arrested. Harrassers no effect. Now, in Judgement, Vivi lives her life in permanent arrest, married one of the Judgement employee, and results 2 brothers. They and the rest of the Maternal Departments took good care of these 2 kids, and grow up healthy. They school the same Crossban to Graduation on all classes & 3 college levels. Alas. Their (the 2 brothers) vision divides some point. Thankfully, because Vivi's regreted, She's not proud to the second.

Halluo: And what happened next?

Gocce: It's too late. Yes, the second brother made repented at last and brought back to righteous path. But the cursed motivation already stuck on that company, at his second assistant. Now, the second assistant continued this heretic motivation, and rebooted Harrasser.

.

Halluo: I hate this `Harrasser` codenaming, especially to our future guys like these. The Harrasser codename was given by Dasandim to label our enemies back in the days, btw named after entitled social media people. This will compromise our reputation towards our customers of various departments of DNB, considering on our former world they are too sensitive these days, like.. **Tannen hates being called Mad Dog** (BTTF Part 3).

Gocce: Would you like to propose a new label, sir?

Halluo: Uh.. I guess it's not a bad idea. Elders did so with the `Invaders` codename during [Lah-Mboh](https://github.com/Perkedel/Lah-Mboh) initiative.

Gocce: Alright, noted. (look at endmin).. .. Endmin, Operators. You must take weeks of break this time. We must scan the situation happened in that Cartesian. It seems our realms have been compromised at last. Don't know where others at large where at. Until further notice, you can only travel to Mudik City for now.

## Extra talk

Endmin asked about her dream during her death

Halluo: Yes? A stone gate? May I fetch your brain?

Endmin: Feel free.

Halluo: (take phone again) Hang in there..., Now think about that.

Endmin recite her dream internally

.

Halluo shocked flabbergastedly, unable to believe what he just saw

Halluo: Uh.. ... whow... uh..

Endmin: What's wrong? Do you find something?

Halluo: Uh no it's just.... Oh mai God!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHUUoooA!.......

Endmin: (head tilt as cute as penguin)....?

Halluo: Endmin. I... can't believe this. You woke up.... in Stella Sora?!

Endmin: Oh. Elaborate.

Halluo: Once upon a time. Lived a Tyrant. He bears the name name as you are. Of course, nothing to do. This Joel travels lands, conquering stuffs, in a good way. Made few friends, called **collecting soul pact**. It... it was another long time ago!, very close to Blue Archive post-times. It's convoluted, feel free to read these all later.

Endmin: Okay. I saw 2 figures.

Halluo: The one holding mirror is Virigia, and the lantern one is Bernina. These 2 also can be found wandering around Monolith. But mainly, if the Tyrant dies, usually is a mistake made. He woke up in the White Room, beyond time, timeless, and these 2 shows up. Discuss something what did he do wrong, revealed that all up. ...., and once he understood, he asked his virtual assistant, Vita, to open this gate over there. Enter, and you Ctrl+Z everything to certain point in gameplay. Yeah. Well, that's what the legend written in DNB Archive says.

Endmin: (mind blown)... whooaaaa

Halluo: Yeah don't worry about it. The Owner of the universe is stingy (broken reward vs. cost balance, 10 gacha is too expensive compared to many others, did so last minute before launch release btw), and anyway the game's long EOS.

Endmin: I've learned a lot.

Halluo: Oh yes, we DNB traveled different worlds. **Oversaw** everything happened to various worlds. Just.. don't worry too much, it's zettabytes. You won't be able to grasp any at all. take a rest. Adventure awaits when we're safe now.
