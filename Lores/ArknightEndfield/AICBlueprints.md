## Begin

Halluo: Okay here it is. These are the extra-universal blueprints we collected. Also, we got few Aurelynes too along the way.

Endministrator: Thank you. I will review this

Halluo: Go ahead, take a look. ... Wow, remember we did tried some other games long ago?

Gocce: like [Shapez](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/)?

Halluo: Hah, yeah!. That days we had to split em up and unclog stuffs by division, and hunting. hehe hahaha..

Gocce: ahahaa... I don't miss that.

Halluo: Why? hehe?

Gocce: Haard.

Halluo: Come on don't ruin the fun..

Gocce: But in the end we managed. ,.. Tho..

Halluo: Just that's it, I know. I know. We have came back here, minus the extra 2 Layers above. idk.

Endmin: These look efficient. We can use some of those according to demands.

Halluo: Yes, of course! Go ahead., Consult with Fiona, what the world needs. And I'll analyze mine (Perkedel's Cartesians). (start analyzing demands on Perkedel Cinematic Universe)..

## Errored

Alas, some blueprint codes are incompatible cross beholder. Halluo & Gocce has scoured universes, and they failed to see **that each universe has different beholder**.

Endmin: Ugh!..

Halluo: What's going on?

Endmin: The file.. `invalid`??

Halluo: Huh, lemme check, (connect debug cable from helmet to computer).....

analyzing

.

.

Halluo: Oh shit. Uh... this code right here. Hold on, Gocce, (send code telepathy) here code. I believe we glazed over some metadata of that universe we got these codes from. Can you get a look?

Gocce: Already. I have noticed **a pattern**. I've matched em up, and grouped them. It seems your AIC only accept the code, with **this pattern**.

Halluo: What?? Okay. How should we call this?

Gocce: Let's see... `Region Lock`.

Halluo: That's more fitting!, ... for now. I'll take that.

Gocce: Okay, noted.

Halluo: Uh.. Endmin I'm sorry. Looks like we got stumbled upon region lock. Maybe we got to do something else first.

Endmin: (frustrated) Huhrh..

## Blueprint JSON

Because of the Region Lock problem, Halluo, Endmin, & friends report this to the compliance department.

as being new here, Endmin must stand before the Mudik branch Compliance councils who sat high law upon.

Lukro Gibb (Koros' dad): Oh really? You're not be considered.. natural being.

Lukro is the Chief of DNB Compliance. Compliance role is to enforce DNBness & other disclipinary stuffs.

Halluo: God Jesus, here we go again. Careful, sir we got audience watching our records here, don't let em be offended because of your words.

Lukro: Prove it. That you are worthy of the true!.., being.

Endmin understood this question. This to prove components trueness, which is embarrasing

Lukro: Hah, felt awkward huh? ... let us bring verdict, (think).

all councils thinking

.

.

.

Result is `Expected` and the reaction is `OK`.

Lukro: You're lucky this time

Halluo: Argh, Jesus Christ on an Innova, can you pls stop interviewing our guest's private & personal variables? Considering (uh oh cancel the `that is extremely impolite & offensive at first impression`).. .. Sorry.

Lukro: 🗿... You done?

Halluo: Ahem.., pls continue.

Lukro: You're lucky this time coz we expected that you'd felt dispolited at our first impression. In fact we'd like to test and get the result coz we do not accept dishonest people. Speaking of integrity, you're even more lucky, I felt your brain, that you have zero intention to report and block us. Many have done so, it's okay, we've been long used to it, coz we no longer want those dishonest ones. I guess.., **you're appropriate**. Am I right, ladies and gentlemen?

*all councils*: yea yea! she's a nice person, truest one.

Halluo: (felt awkward and uncomfortable of this whole Compliance First Impression test idea, pinch face sigh) Urrrgh!!!......... staa____hp.. 

Lukro: Alright let's get back to business. No wait, I must introduce you. My name's Lukro, Chief of DNB Compliance branch Mudik. Just address by my name, role name is no importance to me. That's Koros, my son, he's the vice, I think you already know him already. And these guys, Subordinates. Meaning these are Compliance Major students, yes Crossban has the law enforcement major, and they are learning with me right now. If you asked, there's a role higher than all Chiefs across Cartesian. My grandpa, Guro Gibb, Head of DNB Compliance Department, and Slashthroat Gibb my dad the head vice. Grandpa, Grumpiest of all, but because of him, nobody dare to intentionally screw others up, to this day. To be honest, I'm very jealous of him, how to be like him. So, Is that all?

Puok: Yeah..

Lukro: Alright. So you're here because you have a problem regarding the file format incompatibilities?

Halluo: Correct, sir. Here, presented by Gocce are two sets of the reference address code.

Box containing blueprint code region Asia, & another region US/EU.

Halluo: One is type A, and other is B. Same code should be, but because of how her factory system internetwork with each other universes, these two boxes are not compatible, that's why we sorted it. Ours, works with the type A.

Lukro: (loathe of region lock start igniting up) I see. Sound like a case to me.

Halluo: Apparently the system only store by the server, not as a downloadable format, so these are just reference to a file across different universes.

Lukro: Hergh.. Think they could cleverly get away with this. Have you made idea proposal to counteract this?

Gocce: already, sir. We propose to build an agnostic format that can be stored locally, and shareable beyond time and rots.

Lukro: (read the proposal also) hmm hmm hmm, so.. **`JSON AIC`**?

Gocce: Yes sir. The whole positions of every item, packed into this file format. We can also make a compression system so that we also can share the whole data under just a QR Code version large-ever, like the day it used to be, Nintendo (with Animal Crossing or whatever it was), ironically.

Lukro: Okay. We'll take this. How'd you apply this? To your factory system?

Halluo: Oh, about that. Well, unfortunately that can't be easily changed (original Endfield already baked, unless they did something that time). She must figure that out anew. But.. at least we can start for ours first (i.e. Endfield New Paradigm).

Lukro: I see. ... ..., Now, Ms. Endmin, considering your job is very related about 1 to 1 with the scientists at West Cartesian, I recommend that you pay a visit to her house. Mrs. Yorin Kumandang. CEO of Bikin Sesuatu. You'll be talking long to her. But be careful, she is very shy, and visitation requires heavy assistance, which we are in luck as we got Halluo, feels like brother sister at this point.

Halluo: Alright, it's one for me. C'mon, Endmin. I'll show you there, which is why I brought you here.

About to leave but

Lukro: Oh yeah one more thing.

Endmin: Hmm?

Lukro: UHm... Firstly I apologize for being very offensive to you and asking your.. sex, and your.. yeah. (turned pale awkward regretness) Uh.. If you wanna know, I've been.. feeling very unsafe around many customers lately. They uh.. spicier and most acidic than my whole family lineage combined. Whatever you do about trading.., be careful with strangers, okay?

Endmin: Understood.

Gocce: Noted.

left the scene

Lukro: What have I been keep doing... God... I did it again (offending another guest with that question).. How many time to sorry, God...

### Bikin Sesuatu Corp, West Cartesian

Endmin & friends arrived

<!-- new owner of West Cartesian factory is girl. like Corin ZZZ & Last Rite, because Chloe Eves voiced both female Endmin and Corin. tho, if asked, pls tell them nothing to do, because by the time we start remaking Endfield into New Paradigm, everyone's retired, and we had to hire a new one. pray we found quality ones. -->

Halluo: Okay so.., Yorin is very shy. I'll do it first, you stay behind those boxes.

Endmin: Okay, (go to hide)

Halluo: (quiet) Here we go.., (unquiet to normal) (press doorbell)!

teng nung!

Yorin has exact similar aura like Corin ZZZ. Clumsy & nervous

Yorin Kumandang: HEAAARGH!!!

Stuffs falling everyone

Yorin: NO no no no no oh no!

Sawblade went through left front door window break prang! rolling for few centimeters beyond the terrace / porch and fell to the dirt ground coin like. Head!, Van Elektronische Lumber logo side.

Halluo: (looking the sawblade)... (look back), It's okay.

Yorin: You got someone, or is it just you?

Halluo: Gocce too, and.. a guest of honor!.

Yorin: Oh snap! Guest?!?!... Uhh uhh uhh

Halluo: Don't worry, uh.. she is nice.

Yorin: Deep breath Mrs. Yorin, (breath in breath out attempt reduce panik)!! __ !! __ !! __.. (does not work, YOLO immediately, look through peek scope)...., (keep chain on and open door)??

<!-- This is a fucking coincidence I swear! There's no way of derivativing this, I swear! Y C, it was an accidental match!!-->

Halluo: Yorin, hey. We have guest of honor, factory expert btw. Come take a look.

Endmin approach to partially opened and chained door

Endmin: (show herself to Yorin)

Yorin: (instead of shy, she synced)???.. (async) (tilt head penguin cute)..

Endmin: (async) (tilt head penguin cute)..

Gocce: Wow that's a spectacle..

Halluo: Interesting..

Yorin: (realize, what did I just do, prang!)?!?!? HAAARH!!, (hide behind door, cover face) Oh no oh no oh no oh no what the hell just happened?!?

Halluo: Hey.. uh.. You okay? Will you let us in?

Yorin: AH YES, sorry, (unchain).., Come in!.., (run immediately to factory basement)!!...

Halluo: Where you going? Immediately? ..

.

.

Halluo: Wow. That was different. What was that?

Endmin: No idea. But it feel.. deja vu? But I never been here at all..

Halluo: .. Save that for later. I think we should follow Yorin. Let's go.

Go to factory now

### Factory floor

Arrived. Yorin is staring at her production megaspace.

Halluo: Excuse me, We are here now.

Yorin: OHo... yeah. Uhmm.. Sorry about...

Halluo: It's okay. Ehh.., People have hard time of meeting new ones.

Yorin: Okay.. .. What was just that?

Halluo: I have no idea. She doesn't either. But uh..

The two. Looks polarly opposite by aura, yet they have similar silhouette

Halluo: Wow.. uh.. may I take a picture

Yorin: Okay..

Halluo take the picture of these 2 *penguins* side by side.

Cekrek!

Halluo: Okay, thanks. So.. we're here for.. Recommendation. As an enthusiast of Open Patent initiative, we brought you the alike expert person. This is Endministrator. Endmin, this is Yorin.

Yorin: (internally excited + nervous) Uhhrm,.. Nice to meet you!

Endmin: Nice to meet you.

Halluo: Alright. So, Endmin is the CEO of Endfield Industries. She make factories.., like you.

Yorin: OH?!

Halluo: And uh.. here's the proposal along the way.

Yorin: Umm. thank you. Can you please leave us for now? Wow..

Halluo: I see. Looks like you're excited. Okay then. Gocce?

Gocce: Hm.

Halluo: Enjoy yourselves, (leaving)

Gocce also follow

Yorin: Umm. uh.. you're that Endmin.. my dad told about you?

Endmin: Yep, it's me!.

Yorin: (blush) Haaaaa.... Uh.. take a look, (show this giant production megaspace configured meticulously of making stuffs after stuffs)

.

### Out back to lounge

Gocce: Brother, new message from Mudik gc (group chat).

Halluo: Oh.. is the assessment ready?

Gocce: Yes this is the one.

Halluo: Nice, (open the attached markdown)...

The document state that JSONing is very useful. And Risk as expected, Undisciplined design

Halluo: Benefit... okay, And risk... as expected.,

Halluo replied `Continue`

Halluo: Wooh.. Yeah.

Endmin & Yorin had a very long talk down there. Sharing intel to each other, until night comes here in West Cartesian. After than, Halluo, Gocce, and Endmin returned to Center Cartesian (Arenod Sediron), to Mudik City to call the day.
