# Unbox the new "Fairphone" quote on quote

## Pre

Lukro is speaking.

> Greetings, Endministrator. Cut to the chase. Over here is your birthday gift (based on declared legal date you picked on Account Signup). This is a "Fairphone" from the Surreal Blender Meme factory you helped a couple months ago. I hope you enjoyed it.  
> This rebooted brand of device is inspired from the original Fairphone & Framework companies back in their age. That time, The two being different, have a similar goal is to revolutionize the ease of servicability, & maintain so. It is very good, and people alike of us sought after these brands, and in fact a default brand we chose for every computer device equipment procurements. **Alas, however**, the companies somehow bankrupt a century later, and then forgotten by times. We have yet able to build any details regarding the dramas behind this, but I can presume that corporate greeds will always prevail in all worlds that expects "survival". One way for this is to maximize profit. And that, is obtained through the most damage or most inviability of repair, which is **Planned Obsolescence**.  
> Apologies for my repeated offensive talk. I am not in favour of ruining your birtday mood with such a grudgeful intel like above. But hey, atleast I can give you a random intel you don't need but interested at any point.  
> Handing over the thank you, the people of the factories sent you greeting. I handled the payment, so please treat these items as the gift for you.

If the Birthdate of someone is unknown, or based on a calendar that ultimately absolute incompatibility even with UNIX time, then the value on the KTP's variable `birthDate` will set to cron that's basically `7 feb`, our first Kaorfa's birthday. Don't be surprised if there's lots of birtday stuff going on to those people on that day, it's because we cannot figure out their birtday!

Endmin: (turn chair) Wow, What a touching message.., Okay, (put box on table). Hmm. Fairphone.

But the box lacks Fairphone nor Framework branding, instead a usual venerated **OpenCX**. That's because to respect the trademark as usual, and even there's no need, we can't just fool anyone into rebooting already PD'd brand name just for it right?

Tear the wrapping.

lift the box by the lid, and let let bottom box gracefully fall.
