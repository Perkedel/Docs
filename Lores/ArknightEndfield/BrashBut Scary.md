# Brash but Scary

Endmin wears eyes mask.

it looks badass but some people felt scared of that. Kinda looks like a megacorp villain.

## Begin

The Mudikfielders had to greet these students that are notorious for being afraid of many things. that's because they taught wrongly by a corrupt teachers over there. Their school is not managed by Crossban.

Gocce: There is no other way it seems. You must greet those kids anyway.

Halluo: What? okay then, hope this ends real quick.

Come out to stage

Halluo: Okay students, here she comes!

Endmin come onto stage.

The mask scares the kids aaa scream crying signal in danger, thinking she is an evil villain with that mask

Endministrator: (they are afraid)?!, 💔💔💔💔💔

Halluo: (internal sigh, forced keep smile, I hate my life)....

Galah: I got an idea, one sec, (install hologram expressioner over her mask)

Now her mask emit cute emotion eyes

Galah: Perfect!

The kids no longer scared and cheered Endmin yeay

Galah: They've wrongly taught, keep this hologram on when Endmin face those kids.

Halluo: (async) Okeh 👍

Endmin: (async) 👍

Galah: Just do the brainrot script next as long as you can,

Endmin: Dance brainrot (loading animation pose)...

Galah: While I scan how to fix them.

Halluo: I'll signal the discrepancy (`ies` intentional grammar error).
