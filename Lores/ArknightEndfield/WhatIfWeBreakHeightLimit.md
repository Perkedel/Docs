# What if we break height limit

The drone manufacturers felt too much of obeying law. They're licking law's boots,feet, and asses, ew! Idc! I want to fly above 120m!!

Family Guy Moment

## Begin

A whoop drone laid down on ground.

Arm. activation

Fly immediately, throttle up max. Only fly it high, no going anywhere.

the drone reaching to stratosphere.

Watchout! there's a large ferry airplane, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, **SWAAAAAAAAAAASHH**!!

Control box hit, lost 101% of control, airplane is going to crash

everyone screaming, they're absolutely going to die!!

Koros Gibb: Wai-wai-wait. This had to be propaganda right? I mean.., yeah., .., it-.., it could happen..

Descends really fast. pilots can only pray that God accepts them at Heaven's gate.

.

impact, **JEGEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR**!! Everyone's gibbed, body parts goes everywhere

Koros: uh..... ORGH!, seriously!...

.

.

Koros: Idc!-, Whatever this thing is. You're not scaring us anymore. Any limits manufacturers impose, bullshit, proprietarist partialist. NO no no. I don't accept this. We make stuffs. We make them for people. People are adult. And if there is kid, adults will supervise. shall be. That's simple. Fucking simple.

Jump cut to rescue. More like autopsy. The SAR team are salvaging everything they could out of these rubbles, while at the same time fire department guys extinguishing the fires to give way for the SAR department guys.

Koros: Just... let us!.... fucking fly!!..... above Hundred Twenty Meters. Deadfuck!!.. .. .. .. .. simple!.

These are the carcasses, items, everything they found, laid next by the scene by the starboard (right side, pilot cabit northway) of the plane.

Here are the ID cards the team found. Shown like fan deck of cards. scroll through different cards with various levels of burns. Poor bloods splatters for nothing but under their identity cards on TV.

Koros: Stop the simulation already, no! You can't show even elders this one, they'll be coward, no. I mark this hoax. No more bullshit PSA, you're (do not say `Ban`, DNB rules!) b... whatever, To Judgement realm., reeducation! (stop video) stfu!.
