# Tales of the Grumpy Gibb

Gibb family is notoriously very grumpy. So grumpy they never had true friend.

Recommended to turn this to MV, we need creative teams about this!

## Pre

Lukro Gibb: NO.., This is crazy!!

Duyok: Sir. .., I suggest that you really meet her in person. As a High Order Staff (a Veteran / long play leveled role) at DNB, one shall bravely take on such risky assignment, even they'll definitely be killed.

Lukro: (gave up).... I don't want mistake anymore.

## Legacy

Once upon a time, live Lukro Gibb. He was a police at a small town, Mudik. He had a friend, Julto. They were together.

The police there catches criminals. One day, Julto concerned. He asked Julto, if his dad got convicted, is to protect him from being arrested and prosecuted.

Alas, days turns south as always. Suddenly, Julto's dad ultimately got convicted. As he has been scoured, unfortunately, this crime is beyond protection. Unhelpable. He did this to himself. As the result, Julto's dad must be prosecuted. Initially, Lukro did tried to remove the accusation, but again, his corruption is corruption. Like it or not, Lukro forcedly has to do it, because this corruption already made others suffered.

Devastated. Lukro could only sit in depression inside the glass box office room. And Julto's trying to break in to revenge

Julto throw hammer to glass, but Lukro's unphased. Lukro could only see his devasation and feel of betrayals.

Julto: **TRAITOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** YOU FUCKING PROMISED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH

Iluyo: (use hypnotist power to weaken Julto) Julto!!

Julto: EArgh!..., (fell to ground)...

Reflic: (cuff Julto)!!!, !!!,

Iluyo: Pls, this is for your sake. Lukro only works for the people, not just yourself! I beg you, stop this!

Julto: (boohoo) AArghAAAAHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.!!!!!!!!!!....

years have passed. The arrest for breaching officials only makes Julto more insane. Even thrown to Judgement and schooled in Crossban, and taught to stop being selfish only makes him more. He gone insane.

Lukro visited insane asylum department in Judgement Realm. Heavily guarded by 2 on the other side there, Julto being wrapped in insane bag suit, placed sit on the chair facing the glass upon visitor side. Lukro entered the room, and began confessing his disappointment towards Julto.

Lukro: Hey, Julto. I'm sorry, but I can't be here for long, for our safety here and out, so I'll be quick. You also did this to yourself. You could've been gone better. Your father did the corruption, and I hope you learned the lesson. Just why... why, you so selfish, and chose to... for yourself exclusively, when you could've become... to better. for the people?.

Julto can only be silent. He lost his language. Refused to obey how world works. Refused everything but expect his dad to not be arrest, or basically Lukro to not betray this promise made long ago.

Lukro: I'm sorry. I tried all, but you only think like that, and chose that. I guess.. I'll loathe myself for about doing this. ...

.

Lukro: Goodbye, (stand up & leave just like that)!..., ....

Lukro Go through door, and leave scene

10 years passed to today. Lukro once again did the [offensive interview to Endmin](AICBLueprints) as usual to every guests. Regreted himself. Realized since then, His coerce of loathe against dishonesty of feeling, felt way too much. One shall not over-expect they would not eventually betray you like that. There will always be. What's the correct answer is... **move forward**. Impossibru, but that's the only way of life.

Midnight, Lukro briks Halluo. Lukro wants to chat to tell feeling.

Lukro: (selecting Halluo)....., (call private)!
