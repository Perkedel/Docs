# Tales of the Grumpy Gibb

Gibb family is notoriously very grumpy. So grumpy they never had true friend.

Recommended to turn this to MV, we need creative teams about this!

## Pre

Lukro Gibb: NO.., This is crazy!!

Duyok: Sir. .., I suggest that you really meet her in person. As a High Order Staff (a Veteran / long play leveled role) at DNB, one shall bravely take on such risky assignment, even they'll definitely be killed.

Lukro: (gave up).... I don't want mistake anymore.

## Legacy

Once upon a time, live Lukro Gibb. He was a police at a small town, Mudik. He had a friend, Julto. They were together.

The police there catches criminals. One day, Julto concerned. He asked Julto, if his dad got convicted, is to protect him from being arrested and prosecuted.

Alas, days turns south as always. Suddenly, Julto's dad ultimately got convicted. As he has been scoured, unfortunately, this crime is beyond protection. Unhelpable. He did this to himself. As the result, Julto's dad must be prosecuted. Initially, Lukro did tried to remove the accusation, but again, his corruption is corruption. Like it or not, Lukro forcedly has to do it, because this corruption already made others suffered.

Devastated. Lukro could only sit in depression inside the glass box office room. And Julto's trying to break in to revenge

Julto throw hammer to glass, but Lukro's unphased. Lukro could only see his devasation and feel of betrayals.

Julto: **TRAITOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** YOU FUCKING PROMISED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH

Iluyo: (use hypnotist power to weaken Julto) Julto!!

Julto: EArgh!..., (fell to ground)...

Reflic: (cuff Julto)!!!, !!!,

Iluyo: Pls, this is for your sake. Lukro only works for the people, not just yourself! I beg you, stop this!

Julto: (boohoo) AArghAAAAHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.!!!!!!!!!!....

years have passed. The arrest for breaching officials only makes Julto more insane. Even thrown to Judgement and schooled in Crossban, and taught to stop being selfish only makes him more. He gone insane.

Lukro visited insane asylum department in Judgement Realm. Heavily guarded by 2 on the other side there, Julto being wrapped in insane bag suit, placed sit on the chair facing the glass upon visitor side. Lukro entered the room, and began confessing his disappointment towards Julto.

Lukro: Hey, Julto. I'm sorry, but I can't be here for long, for our safety here and out, so I'll be quick. You also did this to yourself. You could've been gone better. Your father did the corruption, and I hope you learned the lesson. Just why... why, you so selfish, and chose to... for yourself exclusively, when you could've become... to better. for the people?.

Julto can only be silent. He lost his language. Refused to obey how world works. Refused everything but expect his dad to not be arrest, or basically Lukro to not betray this promise made long ago.

.

Lukro: I'm sorry. I tried all, but you only think like that, and chose that. I guess.. I'll loathe myself for about doing this. ...

.

Lukro: Goodbye, (stand up & leave just like that)!..., ....

Lukro Go through door, and leave scene

10 years passed to today. Lukro once again did the [offensive interview to Endmin](AICBLueprints) as usual to every guests. Regreted himself. Realized since then, His coerce of loathe against dishonesty of feeling, felt way too much. One shall not over-expect they would not eventually betray you like that. There will always be. What's the correct answer is... **move forward**. Impossibru, but that's the only way of life.

Midnight, Lukro briks Halluo. Lukro wants to chat to tell feeling.

Lukro: (selecting Halluo)....., (call private)!

Endministrator: Hey, why would I block you?

Lukro: Really? You won't?

Endmin: C'mon, that's moron to do that, that is burning bridge before acquaintance you know. Wrongest way to do business. I've met so many people with various aura lately. I have heard your stories too!

Lukro: Oh.. You did?

Endmin: I felt pitiful to Julto. As you've said, then it's your lesson now.

Lukro: Yes, of course. I will, and I have been trying the best I could. Thank you.

Endmin: You're welcome!.

## Document 2

Scene. Compilation of Lukro's early days in the Judgement works here in the Realm. Lukro used to be a prosecutor in Judgement Realm, sentencing criminals ruthlessly, truth unbound by any terms. 

Bobrok: Case number 2130-12-4173af7d-bb1e-4d7a-9270-b7784125d22c (the last after two dashes, just read `d22c`).

> Suspect: ABCD-XYZ  
> ....

> Intel of Interest: **`He/Him | DNI: ashdjfahslkdfhlakshdlfk`**

hammer 3 times

Lukro palms holding his face. Everytime of this kind of prosecution only clouds the moods. It's boring, yet, it's matter.

Bobrok: Liar. We have seen you all doings. Honestly I'm disappointed, **coz you're so good**. Good at it I admit. Wish that you're a better person.

Lukro: ...

Bobrok: Lemme advise you. Next time, communicate with said party who used your name you think vained you. Failed to give you the demo unit out, when again turns out your contributor did have one. **Everything can just be talked**, you know!. Your Honor?

Hammer 3 times

It's time for Lukro to retire. He is very old.

Bobrok: I'm sad to see you go my friend. I hope our path crosses.

Lukro: What about the students?

Bobrok: Currently it's normal. We should not worry. At least for about 10 years from now, the graduates should perform up to the Judgement standards.

Lukro: ... Then I hope it's so.

.

Gone back home, and do more leisure task. Lukro become the vanguard for partnership with Arenod Sediron, Mudik branch.

Lukro is also indifferent. For any discrepancy that would suffer others, Lukro becomes a ruthless killer that executes / prosecute criminals that has sweet face but corrosive deceits inside. Pouring NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide) upon H2SO4 (Sulfuric Acid / Car battery water / Batter acid).

Lukro has turned down so many partner that attemted to partner with Arenod Sediron. Preventing the almost mistake with Balthezer who disguised before, Lukro digs everyone's background and judge if they are worthy of being partner at all.

Using the same ruthless and offensive tactics, Lukro said it all outblunt, does not care the reactions afterward. Because it has to be. No liars allowed in DNB.

.

Skip through after the [Blueprint](AICBlueprints.md) incident. It was the last time Lukro going to do this. For some reason, Lukro's *pure heart rise from the bedrock encapsulation*. Began to regret. No matter how many preparation did made given to the candidates about the interview that maybe offensive, finally, Lukro regreted.

Duyok: So. How's the apology going?

Lukro: I'm relieved. Thank God. She did not held grudges after all this. (check HT Profile).... (wait, Endmin did not have one yet)?!, At least.. she did not **Blocked** me. DNB is safe.  

Duyok: I'm also relieved to hear, sir. So, agree to phase it out?

Lukro: Do it. I don't care anymore. Rewaken our old rogue catchers. We're going back traditional way.

Duyok: (run script), As you wish.
