# Endfielders Small Talks

Small talk of Endfielder in your Explore gameplay

## Topic: Our old Earth

Assign Endministrator & Halluo in your Team!

Endmin asked if Perkedel's Arenod Sediron used to live in their old planet. They do, it's Earth, basically IRL earth.

Endmininstrator: I have a question. Do you used to live on your old planet?

Halluo: Old planet? Oh, that was.., 300 years ago, we just called it `Earth`. In fact, Areluid & Rumanod born and used to live there until they became space nomads. Perhaps Sediron ancestors also lived there to, but.. it's already long ago. And for now.. (Earth is toxic everywhere, not just physical air, but also the society) yeah don't worry about it.

## Topic: Deadly Sports

Assign Koros & Endministrator!

Originium has risk of giving Oripathy yet we culture them. On Sport we have deadly ones, yet we culture too.

Koros: Endmin, sorry mudding your mood, small question: You said your people cultured Originium despite all risk of Oripathy is that correct?

Endmin: Yes.

Koros: Yeah, Speaking about it, we had the similar keep going despites, called **Sports**. Like Skeleton, you sled head first, at a high velocity & g-force. One wrong move, you gib your brain before anything else, even helmeted. All correct move, you'll get medal and lots of Points!. Just so you know.

Endmin: Oh. Does that statement should make me calm?

Koros: I think so. Coz we clicked agree and accept the risk to achieve big things, afterall.

## Topic: Start from Scratch

Assign Koros & Perlica!

Koros Gibb: Psst. Small talk. Heard this whole Talos-II idea is basically started civilization a new. Beside of Landbreakers, ever you waged a... unecessary (concert to more polite wording) **loatheful differences** (i.e. racism to each other)?.. just asking.

Perlica: So far... we haven't seen any discriminations. Why?

Koros: Oh nothing. Our Arenod Sediron idea was also, start a new. Before that world, OUr.., Terra is.. much like yours. And.. before Sedirons came, Areluids are sceptics. Loatheful Differences, coz we worried too much.

Perlica: Yeah.

Koros: And so, since Duron defeated Balthezer.. That's the anew began. We purged our differences, mixed races and stuffs, coz Duron wished we.. spread more, friends more, partners more. yea.

Perlica: You have an interesting story of yours.

Koros: Ah thancc, it's just.. interesting life.
