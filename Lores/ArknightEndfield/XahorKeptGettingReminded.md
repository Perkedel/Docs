Xahor's Operator Story.

## random sketch

Xahor: Sometimes, memory is best kept abandoned, Endmin. I know it's shocker. But I cannot forget anything. Good things can be reminded at anytime I wish to cherish on. But at the same time, bad things also comes, like it was happened now, even tho centuries have passed. Trust me. Life meant not for remezmerize what we had, but instead to push on forward. 

Endmin: Have you tried one of the *last thing* to make you forget those?

Xahor: I did. But it came back the next day. So only favour I ask you is this. Whenever our way cross again, will you help me accompany a new quest for me?

Endmin: Of course! You're Overseer, we're all friends!

Xahor: Thank you. I have met many, unlike me, and my ascendants & descendants, they don't live long. everytime of their passing, All those incidents comes together. The more I see it, the bigger the boulder is. It gibs me, without being physical.

Endmin: Don't worry, I will always be by your side.

Xahor: Aha... and pls, try your best to never hibernate again. That's painful. I need nobody offline ever again.

Endmin: Don't worry, I'll try my best, you also have eternal friends don't you?

Xahor: True.
