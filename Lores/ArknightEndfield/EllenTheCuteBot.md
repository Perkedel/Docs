# Ellen the Cute bot

## Begin

Endmin is bored rn. She was playing with AIC at the basement lab. So, like usual, she wire the power off the AIC assigned room to somewhere in the lab hallway.

Quest. Wire AIC according to the pointed spot shown, spot by spot. From where you are, the mission goes left way because Endmin wants to go left.

Eventually, Endmin reaches a Powerbank room door. for joke sake, Endmin wired the AIC into the Powerbank room (Room -199), in which will help both the AIC and Mudik Science Center symbiotically.

Endmin finally connected the door. The Mudik Science Center building agrees then consolidated all towers and pylons and becomes integrated. the towers are deleted and the wiring has been merged within the building.

suddenly, a cute girly voice spoke to Endmin's head inside

MudikBot #1: (telepathy) Matur nuwun, Endmin

> [!TIP]
> `Matur Nuwun` = `Thank you` polite version
> `Matur Suwun` = `Please` polite version

Surprised, Endmin immediately take her sword and turn back

Endministrator: (`who's that` turn around draw sword)!!!??.., (nobody)..., (left)?, (right)??, (turn around) (left)?!, (right)?.. .. Hello?

MudikBot #1: (telepathy) Be afraid not. I can speak through your mind. I am an AI which is a soul created by my progenitors.

Endmin: (telepathy) Okay.. Ms. Mudik. What was that?

MudikBot #1: (telepathy) I was saying `Thank you`, in my language, for providing extra power for my external brains.

Endmin: (telepathy) Huh, No problem. Interesting. Obviously, you must've been (pat the wall thinking the building is her) here a while?

MudikBot #1: (telepathy) Yes. Nyuwun pangapunten (but excuse me), but I am in the body, not this building.

Endmin: (whoops, wrong pat) Huh (oh really).?..

MudikBot #1: (telepathy) But for safety, I am currently forbidden to partake activities beyond my room. If you wish, I have granted you an exclusive access for visitation. Just come down from where you are to 4th basement. I will be in my room, -404 (Room minus for o four).

Endmin: (telepathy) Ah, thanks. I should check you out.

MudikBot #1: Also, my name's `Ellen`. `Ellen Van Electronische`.

Yes, Bonnie's younger sister! inspired from ZZZ forgor who's that from Angel of Delusion. Has nanotech to switcu between flesh form and metal default form.

Endmin is going now.

Next phase, walk to 4th basement down there and enter room 404. You'll be lead to a lift. enter lift and choose `-4`

Endmin: `Endministrator`. Just that.

Ellen Van Elektronsiche: You have such an interesting name. Have you received a hurdle from other peers

Endmin: Umm so far no..

Ellen: May I suggest an alternative name, just in case?

like Tobias Rieper for 47.

Endmin: Eehhmm, I guess that's not a bad idea.

Ellen: Then I shall propose you one. Additionally, you cannot use `JOELwindows7` name beside our first Kaorfa. Just saying.

Endmin: Got it. It was long ago during my reawakening. Don't know how, but yeah.

Ellen: Oh..

Endmin: (let go `Open`)..
