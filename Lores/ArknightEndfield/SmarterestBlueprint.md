# Smarterest Blueprint

I'm tired of having to hunt Blueprints and manually assigning factory steps, in the end!  
If only Hypergryph could've seen this appeal oversight, I'd rather hear server overload but it's theoretical to quickly finish the game, like Hoyoverse ultimately had to add auto Suibian Temple because managing Bangboo powered labour factories is honestly not a tedious I enjoy either.

## Begin

an experiment has conducted here in Mudik Science basement lab.

Endministrator: Oh hey, good morning. What is that?

Halluo: Oh hey, Endmin! Check this out, (launch macro)!

Part of the area that produces Iron Batteries deletes and then replaced with blueprint that produces steel batteries. The placement slightly moved about 5 blocks because this production takes larger space for those

Halluo: I have Macromized the AIC! Say, you had a client that demanded material, umm.., no longer need B Buck capsule, look at that,

Endmin located B Buck capsule factory set

Halluo: Back here, now wants `A`.., (replace that area with A Capsule)!.

Buck Capsule B set deleted. Blueprint buck capsule A set spawned

Halluo: Pretty cool right! Had you guys thought about this you can quickly finish the main quest, bruh. yea

Endmin: Can I have it?

Halluo: Oh definitely! (give paper at this desk) Papers here, take a read.

Endmin learns this special mod of **Smarterest Blueprint**
