# Clone Me

Family Guy Moment

an ancient document Halluo & Gocce found. It's a document of Clone Proposal experiment. Bascically, Joel grew too old and he will die eventually. So he proposed clone permission to few franchises. This approved franchises are allowed to use Joel's name. The franchises includes Arknights: Endfield, because the MC on this franchise is *base*-able.

## Doc

Once upon a time in Realizer Realm. 2026 January. There was no DNB yet, but Dasandim planet collab with many other regions under Intergalactic Police to catch criminals across realms. That era was full of stress, and here, contributors were executing a contigency mission just in case. Well, the experiment went wrong.

Joel Robert Justiawan (Original): ....., I have assembled you all here for a very... very very very, ...., important, and interesting matter.

Kenichi Urashima: Kaorfa 🙇‍♂️!!-, pls forgive me!.. I was drunk yesterday!! (actually no BAC)... umm no... It wasn't liquor, I did not. I was suddenly received another emergency commission when I was doing yours. It's stressful, I've (shy to say losses he got after that tragic but successful emergency commission)....., I accidentally chose female.

JOELwindows7 (OG): Can it be retrieved back?

Peoz: We apologize, sir. We tried. 

### Flashback the Seven Keys

Successfully opened the casing. The keyholders had doomscrolled far and finally have found where the mistake is.

Peoz: Okay guys, there it is!

Baofedan: Oh snap!..

The proposed endmin over there is intertwined with other points. In case you have no idea, Timeline branch is very sensitive. One wrong move, the whole Perkedel Cinematic Universe is gone.

Peoz: God.... I hate risking any of this. Weren't we trusted to just audit it?

*all*: Yea yeah..

Peoz: Argh.... f-

### End of flashback

Peoz: You came with us too didn't you?

Yes Joel did. Kaorfa is the 8th key to approve all the sevens.

.

JOELwindows7 (OG): Well.. it was my fault (for proceeding the experiment during highly stressed).

Kenichi felt he was terminally screwed up

.

JOELwindows7 (OG): I should keep taking more breaks. God!.... How many times I have to tell mom `I got reminded again`?..

.

Kenichi: (wanted to speak `what about me` but Joel seems extremely upset)

.

Joel: I'll take it. **I can change it later**.

You can transform again in your *manifest sarcophagus*.

Joel: And class dismissed. Nobody gets punishment. We must return serving the Interpol, but pls do not force it. The criminals have high power, if not learned, will cause great loss.

End of file

## Return to now

Halluo: Hoeugh.. That's.. embarrassing. .. Long short here we are (alive & well). We got.. the Endmin a... *cute girl*...

Gocce: Yeah... I hope he didn't regret this. And it appears he did not do the transform.

Halluo: Well let's not privy into that.., ..., Let's treat that as a... *the rest is history* (rainbow imagination gesture) 🌈.... .
