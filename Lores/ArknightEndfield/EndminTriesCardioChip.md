# Endmin tries CardioChip

After it found that Originium does not work on Hypergryph's assimilated universes, Endministrator tries CardioChip. CardioChip is a combat booster system, but also can be used for various activities. It was designed for that else, but nowadays usable for many types of typical activities, especially combats.

## Begin

Halluo: Morning, Endministrator. You're here again in the Gladiator arena, coz you will learn about (take the unit and show her), **CardioChips**.

<!-- Endmin adrenaline tendency did not increase unlike other wearers. Instead it increases HP. Huge tolerance! -->

CardioChip Belt. A Techno-magical system boosting your heart organ. It is worn like wearable stethoscope, wraps around chest.

Halluo: To apply this, (technomagically unshirt)-(fingersnap)!..,

Endmin: (aroused with big pec) Ah!

Halluo: Oops, sorry, focus, (paste the stethoscope unit to center chest)!-like this. The belt will automatically appears holding it in. (oh no, Endmin is female, let's not let her show her boobs today) Oh.. you don't have to open your shirt. Just plop it in like I did. It can went through.

Endmin: Like... (replicate action plop it in)!, this?

Unit activates

Endmin: Whoaoa.. (feel chest is pounding) oofh, oofh!..

Halluo: Yea like that. Don't panik it's (disorientation & heart palpitation) normal, .., you'll get used to it., in a minute.. .. Now, have you installed Remote mod I told you?

Endmin: Yes, I did., (left hand hologram watch open that up)..

Halluo: So, select that CardioChip system.

Endmin: (saw it) This one?, (tap)!

CardioChips virtual FPGA ROM assignment screen. Looks similar to Duet Night Abyss Demon Wedges assignments.

Endmin: Ooo

Halluo: Okay, test dragging one ROM into any of the slot. I hope you also moved the ROM file I included with to the correct directories

Endmin chose the Extreme ones that required huge tolerance

Halluo: Whoa wait careful don't be reckless!

too late, light explosion juaaarng!!

Halluo: OH SHIT! (prepared to call CPR)!.......

Endmin's heart only kicked her chest hard for 10 second. Then that's it. No cardiac arrest overload.

.

.

Halluo: Hoff... You okay?

Endmin: I feel much stronger. But don't know which one.

Halluo: You just dragged Physical ones, that strengthen your muscles without macho. You're Physcial Slasheer.

Endmin: ...., (punch the Dummy just already there)!

The dummy throw across to the wall over there and gibbed..

Halluo: Yes.

Endmin: (take off the ROM)!..,

ROM placed back in Inventory.

Halluo: Wait. .., How strong is your heart organ then?!..

Endmin: Remember, I am made of Originium

Halluo: Yea yeah.., Jesus.... Wow!... That ROM there you just dragged, is insane, 120 Tolerance required. Had it was somebody regular with no modded heart of ours, their heart explodes and the whole room full of blood everywhere. Scary. (Endmin's heart is that strong)... Huuuuuh.... Interesting..

Endmin: What's next?

Halluo: Well.. you'll use the strong ones, but Operators.. they'll be assigned the appropriate ones too. Basically, just press Auto-equip there to apply the best ones for you automatically.

Endmin: Got it.

Halluo: Okay. Now, We just got the special ROMs.

Operators then invited to this Gladiator briefing room here.

Now sit and listen up. Endministrator has applied her best configs, because there is a ceremonial actions right ahead.

.

.

Halluo: These are Central ROMs. You drag these circle onto the center slot there. These ROMs are designed just for you, so, the Auto Equip shall pick the best according to your prowess type. All of these, will activate Originium, so now you can express Originium based power everywhere, yay!!

Perlica: Wait, then the Oripathy effect will active again?

Halluo: Good question. That is why, before we start, everyone who's *infected* will first need to be converted. also the not, will also be included in this blessing. Just sit and relax, Oripathy will no longer a consequence, the Oripathy shall be cured. Endmin, you do the honor.

*all*: Oooo.. no way!

Endmin: (left hand lift)......., (bless all Operators brought here into Orisync) (orange triangle hologram beaming)!!!!!!!

.

.

Operators looked their hand and feel themselves can breathe easier suddenly.

Halluo: You're now free. You're now Orisynced. Welcome to Perkedel Cinematic Universe.

.

Operators yay cheer woohoo!

## End

All Operators & Endmin wore CardioChips, and have their power works outside Hypergryph. Yay!
