# Designing a Drone

Another day at Mudik Science. The Mudikers & Van Elektronische in collaboration with Endfield Industries are designing drones.

## Begin

Later at some point.

Koros Gibb: Aha. Yeah. heu eum.

look overall Van Elektronische peers

.

.

Keep looking peers one last time for 2 seconds and then focus back to Koros

Koros: But I have problem. Lemme straight.

now look back

Koros: (scroll and open the blueprint file of the last revision of Endmin's drone), (point out soldered battery & exclusivelive internal memory) Look at this. Seriously? Wow. I trust we have a fatal differences, that I hope you can learn from us when you should... think for the people. Uh... Okay, the arms soldered ultimately coz that's the best strength it could be done but... Batteries too? C'mon, Endmin. In our world we already had companies like DJI soldering eMMC permanently causing we must transfer it all by their app, incompatible with a standard API of sort unless you do some hackery idk, no ideas on detail. Do you have any comments on this?

.

Gocce: Wait a second, Koros. I've suddenly popped an idea.

Koros: Alright, .. yours (go ahead).

Gocce: My apologies, but.. Endmin these day just for it had a point now.

Koros: WHat?!, Oh, so now you're now defending the proprietarism Endmin's doing?

Gocce: Not quite, infact not at all!. Remember, on another complimentary files, we'll have the dedicated disassembler jigs (that will also available to customers, even included in starter packs), specially the desoldering and resoldering bits and stuffs. Coz make note, guys: It's the ultimately choice these days and age. Last week, the Mudikers did have a quest, involving recon and provoke. At that time, we successfully provoked, and then the environment has been changed by the enemies, we crashed our drone, but thankfully we lost from the enemies. Tough drones btw, but they'll (enemies) always have `L` screws, or even Robertson's ones too who knows. Thing is, I.. uh.. going to go to Endmin's idea, this time. If ultimately we had to lost control & media access for a while, at least make its battery & the memory card hard to remove. The drone must at least secure every evidence recorded until we can reaccess that unit. Additionally, uh.. It's no longer matter of the tactical, but also casual settings. Remember, we had *Landbreakers* our version too in here! They're as sneaky as slyfox!

Koros: (pinch nose bridge, forcedly had to agree).... (sigh) heuh... okay... Make sense.. (lost comment) What else? What about the press?. Van Elektronische is known for Repairability. Exposed screwholes with standard designs, bla bla bla... Endmin you gotta think about the people whose been used to our design like that.

Endmin: Well, Include the minimal but very usable repair kits on the starter pack? You know the Ancients did that, and we had figured out the abstract of that.

Koros: That's one. anything else? People gonna be mad you know, we must work together to make clarification like a corrupt person busted and panik, but we're not, just.. this change. Guys?

Cobere Van Elektronische: Vouchers for spare battery, and the service?

Koros: Okeh, that. Soldering is very tedious you know?..

Endmin: Another case alternative where we have *passworded screw* puzzle design?

Koros: What's that?

Endmin: (telepathy broadcast)!!...

Top case can be replaced with an alternative design. This one has Battery caddy, and the locking system is a novelty puzzle. This alternative design is for modding & research use case.

Koros: Haah, there you are (how unusual / tumben). I thought you're burdomucking Rossman.

Endmin: I'm not a heartless CEO either, you know 🤷‍♀️😆.. Remember the researchers before they the deployment stage.

Koros: Yess!. ... So what? We agree to this?

Gocce: Peers. It's conclusion time.

Koros: Right. New Drone Evolution. 2 Case design, `Deploy` and `Research`. The `Research` maintains the ease of repair, maintenance, examination (CF Express slot), and `Deploy` secures that (all batteries & memory internal). Whew! Almost got us there!

Cobere: (slowly, right hand show your fist)....!!!

everyone's suspense attention

Cobere: **👍!**

everyone applause yeah ah haha
