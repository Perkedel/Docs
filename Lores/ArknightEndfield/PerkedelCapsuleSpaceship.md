# Perkedel Capsule Spaceship

DNB had an experiment back then in Middle North Cartesian of making ISS-like spaceship RV designed for observative research purposes. It was now abandoned due to ineffective and the portaling conquer much more effective. What to do with these then?

## Begin

Sophia Doohickey, daughter of Halluo. Miss Doohickey likes to make crazy stuffs. Any weird experiment stuffs like [this one](https://youtu.be/0JvRHZVTLyI). 

Halluo, Sophia, Gocce, and Endmin come into the spaceship shop at North Cartesian. They are buying spaceship in collab with Endfield Industries to do similar thing with Dijiang, but Perkedel's old Earth (our live irl).

Yeipa: Fellow Overseers!, welcome! Oh, Halluo, Gocce, Sophia. Welcome. And uh.. who is this? New friend?

Halluo: Oh yes, my new friend. This is Endministrator.

Yeipa: (no pecking way) Ah??!.... No way... Endmin??

Endministrator: (wave hi)?

Yeipa: Yea-hello!... Wow.. This is surreal. I just heard about you recently. You're legend! Welcome.

.

Yeipa: So, what do you need here?. We got Doohickeys, new release, (take out new unit) a dice that can beep and shake itself. Want some?

Halluo: Ahaa, thanks. but we don't need those right now. (straight to mission) We need spaceship

Yeipa: (no way, finally) Oh??

Halluo: I believe you still hold **those** stocks to this day, haven't ya?

Yeipa: (moved no tear) Uh... uh spaceship, yes? .. Uhh, yeah I can show you now.

Halluo: Get me the best one

Yeipa: (of course they would)!!, Of course!.. .. yes right this way.

### Capsule Shaped Space Station

Yeipa: Here it is. The giant RV for space. What do you think?

Endmin: Looks cozy. Almost like my OMV Dijiang I would say.

Yeipa: Oh really? Yeah, this is... the largest we have. Basically, umm.. our great ancestors, yes, uh.. did built this idea first. Yea-uhm, to do the conquering stuffs, like the Great Duron wanted. This is one of them. We'll put each of these above the planet across each realm we'd want to acquire, stay there and look afar from here to see realtime status and like that.

paying attention deeply

.

Yeipa: But yeah, soon after the Arenod Sediron found better ways, is to portal it out. Directly to that lands, and there it goes. Thankfully no danger so far, and hence, this... proved inefficient. So we left it. And so here we are now, dormant to this day, waiting for buyer. You guys... want to conquer realm? You could've asked Arenod Sediron, at the Overseer office, you buy Realms, the markets has been way expanded than ever before!. Why this here?

Halluo: Thanks for the headsup. We're not conquering new realm this time.

Yeipa: Huh?

Halluo: We're reconquering.., Old Terra.

Yeipa: Old T.. Huh, You.. want to... **Recolonize Earth**???

Halluo: It's for her.

Sophia: Hi!

Halluo: We're going to do Earth mission.

Yeipa: ... ... Dude. ... It's been long time. We never thought of Earth over the past few centuries anymore.

Gocce: But isn't Earth the root of evil? Had finally noone at Overseer anymore to settle to suppress those, we'd receive way even more evils than if we still.

Yeipa: ... ... .. .. I, understand. I just afraid, you'll find more dangers now lately.

Halluo: Just don't worry about us. We're fighters. This ship has defense right?

Yeipa: Oh yeah, it is. That's why the conquer. It's equiped with acidic force shields, cannons, and spear rounds. That's what it's for.

Halluo: Yeah. Take it. How much?

Yeipa: 500 Million (Pts).

Yep, the market is super down

Halluo: (pitiful, it should be around 10 trillion) I see. Nobody's into it, it seems.

Yeipa: Hurgh,, yeah. .. We had to sell other doohickeys to keep us afloat. Despite.. enough fed, .. I still feel having to hold all of these, to dust, is a huge burden. DNB even forbid us to dismantle to make more doohickeys, coz one day they may need it. Idk until when. So far, there's no need, likely it's until Jesus comes back, you know.

Halluo: Yea yeah. I feel ya. So, 500 million?

Yeipa: Ao!, pls wait, (portal the stash) lemme take my trader....., (cashier machine found, grab it) here it is.

Halluo: EMV? (alike of QRIS)

Yeipa: Got one, (preparing transaction checkout) hold on.... ... ... (ready) Okeh, Just this one?

Halluo: How about.. you add random Doohickeys. The best that you got. 100 Boxes.

Yeipa: 100 Gacha box? Okey, (add another, gacha box 100 of them).... Five hundred million, and 1 million. This ship, and 100 Platinum boxes of Gacha Doohickeys.

Halluo: Let's go.

Yeipa: (checkout) oke pls wait.. ... (ask pay) EMV ready!

Halluo: (open wallet app)...., (scan EMV QR)..., (pin)... (done, show proof)?

Deed certificate printed

Yeipa: (examine the phone screen)?.... Yep!. And it's yours!

.

.

Yeipa: (take the certificate), (examine).....

The result still good to this day

Yeipa: Wow. Never been used. The inks never *dry*. Wow. Just wow. ... .. (hand over)?

Halluo: (take), (give to Sophia) There you go girl. And so, I'm bring this to earth. Don't worry about it, if we failed this test, and must leave, we won't refund. Coz anyway we need space station, to look above. as we know already, nobody even Arenod Sediron had Space Station above.

Yeipa: You do? Thank you!!! Argh shit!.. I thought you toying me around like this.

Halluo: Hey, don't mention it. That's what friends do. So, we ready? Btw, we'd be running very fast. I just hope this ship has anti-dilation system, is there is?

Yeipa: (go to the control on the front there) Yeah!, there is.

follow

Yeipa: The **Time Pieces**, from Chronos (A Hat in Time). They used it not only as energy source for their space ships, but also it has an effect that allows then to **lightspeed without causing time dilation**, pretty cool right? See, old tech still works.

Halluo: Cool!. Then we can go now.

Yeipa: (initiate the portal) let's see..., ah, (portal now to earth space area)...... (done) there you go, (confirm)!

Opens

Yeipa: Here we go, (push thrust forward)!....

The capsule enters the portal into the overworld realm.

Yeipa: Easy, easy..

The Time Pieces also prevent G-force from sudden launch of movement.

Arrived

Yeipa: There you go, Look at the starboard

go to starboard side of the front glass

Yeipa: Let's see if it's perfect..

From here, The earth sizes a fist of adult hand

Yeipa: Perfect! If you want to rotate it feel free, but I suggest don't, coz that's looks like you're attacking, but it's up to you. And.. for the distance where we stand by, it's.. to prevent sun from being blocked by our ship here. In fact, this is also more away than the moon ('s orbit) there. Sophia? Endmin? Guys?

Endmin: Looks good to me.

Sophia Doohickey: El Gee Tee Emm!

Yeipa: Right, if you have any question, don't hesitate to ask. We always provide you the best solution for your problem, so ask away. Now, I shall take my leave (open portal back to home), see ya! (leave scene close portal)!

.

Sophia ceremonially go sit on the pilot center chair

.

Endmin then stands by Sophia that just sat on it. left hand hold Sophia's right hand. Feels like Endmin now has a brand new younger sister, or brand new daughter like she did with Perlica decades ago.
