# Bullies Never Ignore Own Family

One of the Overseers team over there had just finished their shift of a mission. Let's take a look

## Begin

Lukro Gibb: Sovie! Evening. How you been?

Sovie Raharjo: Sir! We just finished.

Lukro: What mission was it?

Sovie: A Suicide case, `4b3700a1-e8ef-4ebe-8946-dab5ea15735e` (just read `15735e`). It's uh.. another fatal underestimation, (give handy-term) here's the intel.

Lukro read.

A female human student, aged 16, commited suicide after receiving bullies from her classmates. She asked help from teacher and instead get punishment for *Teacher pet behaviour*. Now asked parent instead got insult for not being toughen up. All is lost and life is therefore worthless.

.

Lukro: .... .... Yikes.

Sovie: (agree). ..

Things like this happen lots of time, this one therefore is a monday after sunday night, but remember monday after sunday night nowadays translates to unexpected airstrike from enemies, no longer literal.

Lukro: Well, since this is a mental gymnastic work, I'll give you (loading procedure)....., (found) 2 weeks of vacation, and your team. Plus the salary all for that. And now lemme tell you. Me, and the whole Gibb.... despite also a family of bullies.... would never ignore if any of us were in danger, not to mention dissen up over anything underestimated. Especially mental psyscho' stuffs. In fact, DNB was inspired from our... family behaviour. Yes, toughen up. But that does not justify to leave that soldier to face it all alone. Anything happens automatically means calling backup even they don't want to, don't you think?

Sovie: 👍 MM!..

Lukro: Yeah. So yeah, take a break, lemme take it from here.

## End

Search suicide hotline

The whole school has been raided and the students have been arrested onto Judgement Realm without mercy. Only 1 student made it through parole, because this one dislike bullying, and afraid to call out. He has been moved to class next door at this Crossban.
