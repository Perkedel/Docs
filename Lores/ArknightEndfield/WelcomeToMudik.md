# Welcome to Mudik

The 3 Weeks are passed, and Halluo & Gocce must go homeland for due to settlement quota. As promised, all Ver 1.0 Launch Operators & the Endmin are brought together dimensionally.

## Begin

The duo MultiTalent Disciple & Endfield Industries crew have arrived at Mudik city. Mudik is a region in Arenod Sediron realm. Located far back by the back of Arenod Sediron central castle.

Ship touchdown. Shutdown ship

Halluo: Here we go!!-(disengage seatbelt), (recheck situations back)..

And Gocce follows in. Back hatch opens

Halluo: Okay guys, here's my Homeland. Firstly,

Crews dropping off and stand by Halluo

Halluo: I apologize that this is not the capital, in fact this is where we live. Very far far by the back of Arenod Sediron's palace. Of course, we not only conquers dimensions but also the dimension we had here. How much progresses have goes, right?

Endfield crews are awaiting next instructions.

Gocce: Crews complete.

Halluo: Praise the Lord! We made it, can we start now?

Dialogue option: `Yes`

Endministrator: Let's go.

Halluo: Okay, good! Follow me, to the Science Center, my this bus here.

The Crews onboarded the bus. It feels like that moment: Pariwisata. In DNB realms, vehicles drive on left, hence steers on right. Passenger comes in from the left front & left back. This bus model has driver door (right front) openable.

Halluo: Alright, take the seat whatever it is, no need fighting, any seat is fine.., ..., It's just a bus, tho we chose Panoramic model to enjoy some view while we're going... ... Take it slow!.., ...

Crews are occupying seats. Halluo & Gocce scan in realtime

.

.

.

Couple Minutes later, all have settled.

Halluo: Okay, Runnix, let's go.

Runnix Sediron: (press close all doors button)!, (disengage handbrake while keep brake), (gear in), (let's go)!...

Duke of Mudik, Runnix Arenod Sediron. Just call him Runnix, because long ago, Duke would refer someone else atomic instead of titular.

Dualsense. Speaker emits Hydraulic Brake gas, Doors, and other environment sub-details. Vibration feeling of inside the bus running along the mountainous roads.

Halluo: oookay!, we're off. The trip gonna take some time, and uh.. my apologies if this road is scary to you, mountainous, but relax, Runnix is the expert here. While we're going, Let me tell you a story. Story where it all began. Question, will it be long? Yes it's long, but I know you're tired, that's I have the TDLR for you, sort of.. Are you guys in?

*all*: Okay yeah lemme hear

Halluo: Okay here it goes.

Crayon visualization. Dualsense sensation move focus to this story telling

### Story of Arenod Sediron

Once upon a time, live the 2 girls. Areluid & Rumanod. They are neighbours. Both are simple family. Used to be nomads, but now decided to settle on a land. They farm now.

One day, that night, 3 angels descended like it had happened thousand years ago, but angels this time, offering some kind of artifact. Because those former nomads, should not supposedly stay. They must keep going, spreading science, not to sit still. But they understood, they could only travel right there. So this artifact, lets em do more. Island to islands, continent to continents, and also.., dimension to dimensions! They can go anywhere. The angels also brought them the spec how to build a *private ark*, that gives vessel of transportaion. yeah, spaceship, to make travels.

Now, the nomads are back at it. They continue sharing technologies, know-how, and sciences across the globe. They've explored different dimensions. Countless dimensions. Cold, Hot, Winds, Suffocations, All tried, all thru.

Another day, the bonds between Areluid & Rumanod grew stronger. They want to declare that these 2 are permanently abond. Of course, there's a problem. In order to accomplish God's task, you are required that the male & female abond. That's the basic. Well you see, both Areluid & Rumanod are female. That's not working. So, how do they solve this problem? Good question. That time, Areluid's father dediced to take a rest. It was back to OG-Terra (Earth). They got church, and even luckier, father had an acquaintance who was the priest of that church. So, he consulted. Brought the rest into the discussion. Sounds crazy, female female marriage, insane. But thankfully, the priest has high IQ. Long short, he proposed this:

> Have a generation. each of you shall marry your man. You shall have this, and you shall have that. At the same generation, if either of offspring comes with the otherwise, they must marry. Keep going, until you reach this.

That's right. Have a children. Keep doing this, generation to generations, until any of the descendant of either, becomes opposite sex. It can be Man Areluid & Woman Rumanod, or vice versa!. It was very hard battle. They had to went through the sufferings, that many times, the baby that pops out of each bellies are all female. So they had to find another man, every single time. But, that's the only way. You gotta be patient to achieve this without breaking the mechanism God designed.

Okay, that's a deal should work, let's go back to the ship & sail again. We got more adventure to see. We must go to this location. Let's go.

Um, Areluid, we got a problem. This is not the destination it seems. Why there's a cloud? Were they attacked? No. Looks like the dimension transform position has shifted. Oh shit. We are in a huge trouble. And that's right, amongst the cloud, the Mad Lighting saw an intruder. **ZAP!!** The ship blew into halves (crews gasped)! Open halves, awide.., The ship sliced to halves, and each fell onto the unknown. The Areluids fell onto an empty realm, and Rumanods to Dasandim. Alas, they separated.

<!--
- Areluid fell to new realm, Rumanod half fell to Dasandim
- separated
- we got Duron Sediron of Rumanod is male
- Insicdent Sediron ask saorfa
- go to Areluid realm (now Arenod Sediron)
- help areluid do science
- approval day. rejected, sus that this might be intruder, all external scientist program canceled
- invited by strange participant
- bla bla bla it was Balthezer!
- alsdfla;sdj during balthezer signing, balthezer strikes his true evil of absorb. luckily, he was caught by Duron before that. Duron has power of giving halucination, detecting suicide, and other brain related.
- Areluid win.
- scan scan scan, Areluid surprised, Rumanod has been here the whole time, Duron Sediron Rumanod & Chalar Gupadi Areluid. They are married!
- goal accomplished, show to first Areluid & Rumanod. peacefully can rest to stardust.
- The Arenod Sediron goes on. the rest is history.

nobody sleep in class wow!
-->

Each must live on their own. Luckily, The nomads know all the things before hand. It is up to their prowess and resources there is to it. And Praise the Lord, both Areluid & Rumanod can survive, at least until the final miracle able to happen. What's next? Okay, keep your attention.

Now, on Rumanod side, they were fighting a great wars. Basically, to criminals, at which point is a whole story of its own. But long short, while the most wanted criminals were captured, Alas still, new criminals rises up. Even stronger, too strong to bear. They suddenly had everything. One time, a criminal who bears floating blades massacred Rumanod's company. The book notes it as **Sediron Massacre**. The company was called Sediron, after the Sediron family, a social media company, like.. you know.. and eh.. Sediron Rumanod helped an Initiative called Intergalactic Police to catch those criminals. And yeah that's what happened. It's tragic. Lucky Dasandim can reassemble all of the personels that time, but the bullying was getting too strong and potentially repeatable all day, therefore they decided to call it quit. Sediron Rumanod must leave Dasandim onto the dimension. Sike! (crews surprised internally), You don't get safe. Nope!, The Saorfa caught. Luckily, had Saorfa didn't interfere they sliced up mince again. Now, the Sedirons & Rumanods stuck in the safety of Moderation Realm. Everything's gone, the reputation, glory, and the prime. Poof to dust. Great things shall eventually go. Duron, who was the latest prince at that time, begged, the Saorfas to do something so they can live normally. Well, that's were the point of fate meets. Saorfa was also being commissioned by Areluid somehow, to help their world connects back to the rest of the worlds. And that's where Duron, rest of the Sedirons & Rumanods go. Well, Firstly just a few family member, for safety of course, and I'll move onto the Areluid side.

Areluid side, they were innnovating in *isolation* quote on quote. They're bored. Nothing to do. What to do? Pray. God send message to Kaorfa. Kaorfa called Saorfa to help Areluid, came to them, how do we help. Okay, commission posted. It's on, program that we call.., **Scientist Outreach**. We want to connect, and bring innovation. So, Duron did few, about 3 as the minimal goes for. Notably, the **Heart organs**, Yes, **Made up 🫀 heart organ**, I'll tell you about it later. All these are great science contribution. Guess what happen next on the approval day. **Canceled!**, coz another trouble Areluid that time must face was a traitor is at large. Long short, Balthezer were supposed to be friend, but he is selfish! He wants everything for himself. He wants control! Thankfully it was seen, and so the war explodes, stealthily, people live in fear. So much fear, at the last minute everyone's rejected in fear that Balthezer could be ***among us!***. Stuff like that. Even also btw, Areluid's own children canceled their submission in solidarity!. Welp, after-all, this rejection was really another HR doing CV submission throwaways. Duron is lost, both mentally and physically. And suddenly he was invited by another fellow scientist, who claims used to be one, but laid out somehow. Huh, Areluid must be an asshole to do that? Okay, what do you want. So, Duron accept to stay for a while with him, invited to see his inventions, yadi yada. He had negotiations, and about to be signed next week. And so.. the time goes somewhere. Suddenly, a day before the signing ceremony, Areluid called Duron for an emergency. bla blabla, that guy who invited you to console you is Balthezer oh no! During the discussion, Duron accidentally emited his Halucination ability to the peers. That's it! We can use your power to bamboozle him.

Another long short, the ceremony begin. As Balthezer just signed, he began his power. Stabbing all Areluid people, and absorbing their life force. It's over, Balthezer has the power, Areluid is gone. ... Hahaa, remember Duron's? Dream end! We saw it all, **caught in 16K120!!!** everyone witnessed it! Balthezer lost, attak! Duron used Open Portal under feet to throw him to Judgement Realm!, Rest of Balthezer's princes & princesses tried to assist, Nope, Duron got that cared of too! Arrested!! lmao!, get rekt! Okay it's done. And hip hip horray, declared as hero of Areluid yay!.... amazing awesome.

.

Now what's next? Duron then to be enthroned as the new king of Areluid. Let's scan his background. Wait a minute, WHAT IS THIS?! OH SHIT! NO PECKING WAY!, We must report to the first Areluid! Duron, bring the rest of the family, **NOW!!** Wait, why? Here.  
You should noticed by now, I brought already the important familial names. Areluid, & Rumanod. They were intended to marry each other, but can't coz they're females. At finally last. It's official. **There is opposite sex on either!!!!** Here is Duron from Baser Sediron and Nylar Rumanod. Aaa??, and Chalar Gupadi from Dano Gupadi and Yanti Areluid. Oh shit!! There it is!!! They were married just some times ago! The fucking Areluid & Rumanod, finally!!... **Married**. Iyeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!  
So, the Areluid brought these weds to the Areluid Private room. OG Rumanod especially too, brought in. Reunited!. At last, happy forever after. They have witnessed that the two are now officially weds. They can now peacefully rest. Chrrhrhrhrhrhrrlrlrlling ✨✨✨✨✨.., turned to stardust lingering around the whole realm, overseeing the rest of this realm and the world. It's not death, they just turned into lowest power mode, for eternity. It's moving tears, I know. But, with that in mind, here we are right now.

And so, Duron and Chalar leads the Areluid, now merged into what it is now, **Arenod Sediron**. Combination & a bind of total 3. They've learned the lesson from their parents, that in order to avoid evil from ever occupying any atoms of the world, they must spread. It's expensive, can't be done alone. Thankfully, Saorfa hears this, and reported this to Kaorfa. Now, Joel (Endmin got called and confused), our first Kaorfa.., called in Realizer to bring one of their outreach department, **DNB**. Negotiate, then with Duron as the new king coming up. .., Hey would you like to collab? I can help you conquer places never been stepped by anyone. Yadi yada, he agreed. So that's how it when. The rest is history. We now have uhm.. 9... times 3.. ah, 27 Cartesian points!, now. yeah.

<!--east cartesian was experiment of conquer and leave untouched-->

### End of Arenod Sediron beginning

Dualsense move back to reality.

Halluo: Wow. What a long (scan the passengers) story. I have just recited a whole Sediron movie 4 seasons whole! Hahaah!.. (nobody slept) And oh shit, no way!

Nobody slept, everyone paid attention this whole time!!

Halluo: YOu guys did not sleep?!?, Oh mai GOD!!! Are you kidding me! I mean... I just had.. I just want to bore you, coz the trip here is veeery long! and full of curvy paths!, This city is all mountains you know... HUuUUUUUH???

The crew contemplates the story. Then the Endmin recall about the first Kaorfa, because shockingly named as Endmin is.

Endmin: One question. Who is.. that Kaorfa you mentioned? `Joel`??

Halluo: Ah, good question. Yea, I know that surprises you. The first father of Perkedel was.. Joel. I mean, lots of same name happens all the time. (remembered this Endmin is labeled `JOELwindows7`) But uh.. haha... Oh man..

Joel Endmin: Elaborate.

Halluo: I've just read one of the DNB Archive couple days ago before we leave to here. Lemme tell you a short. Once upon a time, The franchise that holds your world, was going on to be. One day, Back to where Sediron fighting a war, there's a subset amount of contributors doing side quest. It's apprently a contigency protocol, coz of course, everything needs one. Yeas contigency, If there's a worst case scenario, Joel had to be murdered by the criminals, he wants his name survived, so maybe to fetch replacement or something idk. So there it goes. Lots of the stuffs going on. It was.. Gacha Game, if not wrong.. serveral games. Worlds to try. One day, There's another franchise to try for. At that night, the contributor that held the protocol for it this time, ... shell-shocked. His whole family was murdered at last, by the criminals which thankfully caught and prosecuted. Mentally if you wanna know, uh.. no privy.., So, he lost concentration. As the result, **the guy accidentally chose wrong type**. Embarrasing right? JOELwindows7 but female?? Well, no worries, the franchise allows you to transform back to correct type. but.. it looks like... after all this centuries.. 3.., you are you. Hmm.. why is that? I still questioning, why greatest grandpa of ours, decided to keep it anyway... huh.

Endmin: (contemplate about self) Hmmm...

Halluo: Well, don't stress about it. Perhaps... because his decision stands, it stands. And as always, keep this tightly in mind, that **you are no accident**. In fact nobody shall be called accident. If grandpa Joel decided to keep it this way, **that mean he has reason to**. Like... Other franchises would permanently locked you out once you picked, even all of them on one! But why, ... on this one that lets you, ... he left it? Right? Yeah. So, whatever happen, (pat Endmin)!..

Endmin: (blush) Oh?

Halluo: Live well. Take benefit as much as you can, what God has given you. Okay?

.

Endmin: (nod)!.

Halluo: Thank you, (release pat)..., (turn around to init look forward), (deploy collapsing front left seat), (sitt)!. (Enjoy view of the mountains & ups downs trip naik puncak)..

.

.

### We have arrived

Mudik Science Center.

Halluo: (awake) euuhugh..., (struggle open eyes) urghm....., (yawn)!!!... (noticed) Ho,, we arrived? Okay, (stand up & slap close the front left seat)!..., Okay guys wake up!., We've arrived!.

Runnix: (press Drop off button)

Doors open with each stair deploys protruding from the door lip.

### And so in the lounge

The crews have settled a while in the lounge. Halluo & Gocce greet back with their families of the homecoming.

Malluim: Hal! Goc!

Halluo & Gocce hug

Halluo: Mom! We're home. (hug)!.............., (done).., We brought visitors too.

Malluim: Ah! Guests! Brothers, sisters! Guests!!

*all family*: Yea yeah protocol!

The family executed Guest Welcome Protocol

Halluo: Okay guys, I got important report to do, whew, gotta be tiring just for this, but don't worry about me, Enjoy yourself! (intentional grammar error, should've been `yourselves` to refer many). Aand.. remember, don't wander off to any of these research rooms, just explore the outside of the room, coz the equipments are sensitive. Yeah, I'll see you later, uh... enjoy the drinks! (leave scene)

Gocce follows

World Unlocked! Mudik City. Explore.

The grammar error is because Arenod Sediron & rest of DNB are not English native. They speak Bahasa Indonesia.
