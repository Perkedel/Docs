In order to be proficient at factory, **one must read & practice the manual**.

## Begin

Halluo is sleeping at the desk. Reading and practicing the tutorial for each AIC stuffs there is tiring!

Mudik Science Center Basement Wide Area Lab. 1 AM

Endministrator: (slowly approach Halluo)... ... ..., (tap tap tap)!

Halluo: (wake up) heu.., uh, (getting up).. (done wake up)??

Hair messed up. Thankfully no saliva

Halluo: Huh?.. I slept?

Endmin: (pitiful of his struggle) You need some rest? Maybe I should revamp the workflow next time..

Halluo: Uh.., (close software).. yea.., (off the chair), (leave scene to bed)...

Endmin: `Just in Time` method.. I should've do that..
