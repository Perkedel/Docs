## Explain!

- MultiTalent's item codenames are inspired from Holy Bible. Infact the `Talent` part in the product name inspired from Jesus' parable of 3 servants with Talents (Mat 25:14-30).
- Codename Character `Apostles` could've been used in MultiTalent, but Trickal already took it. So we too the other, which many Churches these days use too.
- Main Currency is used to purchase stuffs & insert coins. You get this by completing quests & missions. Some games top ups to main, i.e. only 1 currency, but some other has separate top-up Currency.
- Sub-currency is the in-game's worldly money. Also a reward from quests & missions. Some transactions costs that Sub-currency to commence, such as character & weapon upgrades.
- MultiTalent & Duet Night Abyss Do not use regular but grind Recruitment Tickets through Commissions, all leads unlockable for $0
- Blue Archive Character Rank. `1 ⭐` Blue & Free Character for completing 1st episode of special story event.
- MultiTalent inspires Duet Night Abyss Booster Composition, relabeled `CardioChips` designed after Cardiophilia, heartbeat, and heartbeat fast pounding fetish. Ask the games who stared at that menu for hours!
- Arknights: Enfields heavily modifies their Unity Engine to achieve best performace and the best graphics they could reach, and the consumers would be able to reach. Tho this comes not risk-free, because small VRAMed GPU will crash almost always after just few minutes of gameplay. If this happen, unfortunately you have to switch back to DirectX 11 mode until Hypergrph & Unity fix the smol VRAM overload instability issue.
- Duet Night Abyss Gacha no longer is about character since some beta. Now is only to Skin. Acquire characters by grinding, for $0. Same goes for MultiTalent.
- MultiTalent initial side, West Cartesian is like Duet Night Abyss, Bottom Cartessian is like Time Crisis. Various, because `Multi`.
- MultiTalent's New Paradigm remakes (Blue Archive NP, Undertale NP, Deltarune NP, etc.) will use same acquirement method like Duet Night Abyss. Some Main Stories will assume Original `JOELwindows7` in place of the MC of the original game, and some events will let yourself be the MC alongside JOELwindows7. Some NP's MC may assume different specs but still bearing Joel's name, i.e. Clones or Name-afters.
- Stella Sora requires multiple duplicates to activate Duplicate slot, about twice or thrice acquirement to total it 30 around pcs. **Most games only needs one each, as it should be**. The Blue Archive Duplicate upstar could be considered close enough towards One-each, since it results multi-number of Elephs of that Student / Character.

## Woohoo

Let us know what we missed.
