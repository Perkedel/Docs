# Nobody is Anarchy

## Begin

everyone is press. the press are coming awaiting in a random clarification press conference.

Duyok: You can't keep dissing a bunch of countries, Matrix. I trust you still remember the truth you've been keeping you whole life. You may now and shall utter these words.

everyone's listening

Matrix Gibb: Indonesia we know is long gone. People hard, but impressingly, during that time people can still relacc and act like they can't care anymore, but to just surrender to God, i.e. smile's still 4⭐ (of 6). China while good on the other side still have Workaholism problems like does with Japan same time that time. Yes, those who lost 50/50 on prestigious salary, must suffer through delivery jobs, and even involved themselves onto the process of making alpha to zulu, so they don't late, or else the penalty is as same as using VPN just to play the video game, and banned only because the VPNer timezone shifted (hence caused the game to be suspicious).

everyone then expecting DNB is the most perfect nation

Matrix: But finally, **DNB is not perfect either**. In fact, without these gripes, it's anarchy. For one, Yes, to use Public Social Media and Public Chat you must have a *Driving License* but Social Media (called `POC License`). I personally disagree and DNB should've let that only for Frequency Radios. No. So when they told me, I humbled. I trust you've already heard about Sediron Massacre 2032, and no need to retell what happened there.

Sediron Massacre 2032. After the Vivi's defeat in 2030, and many arrests of Harrassers, the Sediron think it's at least over. Nope, one Harrasser managed to find the source of comms idea for Interpol, which was Sediron. The Floating Knives Harrassers cut slice the whole building and the people in it. Despite all recovered and resurrected, the trauma is too much to retry again. So they left Dasandim, yadi yada Sediron Season 4 Finale. One day, Dasandimian created a bill to protect everyone mentally from the dangers of social media, in tribute of Sediron families. The POC License was born, and it makes now using Facebook, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, anything that's public requires you to enroll in exam and get License, like registering one for Ham Radio.

Matrix: There must be other restrictions in all DNB realms, I have forgotten because trust me..., there's alot (not just because of POC License). Nobody's *perfect* what you want. If that happen, that's egoarchy. Selfish... rules something, you got the idea.

everyone sadd

Matrix: So what's left now is yourselves. Do you live to respect others? or to enforce your way of things selfishly? The reason our Ancients applied this was because of that exact, questions we've been longing to get the answer for. *If there's only a world where people truly respect each other, and if there's a difference never immediately start a war*. Something like that. *if only.., people is honest about their feeling. not afraid of being different.*, **not interested of begging validations**. Right because you had... luxury stuffs.. or worse, people finally obeyed your nonsense DNI rules. Yeah.

everyone contemplate

Matrix: Now it's long happened, nothing about it will change. Talking to strangers, you must respect our reason, and update your license status. On behalf of the High Orders of DNB, **I'm sorry**, we forced to. Thank you. 

everyone relax contemplate

Matrix: Oh and.., about the countries, we don't look after them anymore either. Who knows, some of us here are not native or whatever. It's like Endfields, everybody started from scratch in Talos-II, with these different races. Yeah, it's.. similar in here. Honestly, I'm not good at making apology, so.. do what you will, as long you don't violate DNB, ye.
