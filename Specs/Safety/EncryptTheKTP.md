# Encrypt the KTP

the KTP data is wholely encrypted. each of the card has different encryption keys, which only that holder has.  
If something requires government data, then not only the card must be there, the person him/herself must be there too.  
Once decrypted, the issuer can verify in that place.

This not only encrypt the variables, but also the profile picture too. The card has jumbled glitch image in the box, instead of normal photo, that our AR can decrypt only if you are there.  
How about destroyed face? well, ask the person consent the decryption key to decrypt the image. Once we know the image and other needed data like 3D model of you, we can plastic surgery reconstruct your face.

Please do not lose your card! DNB Account online only store game needed data! Other personal data is yours that hold! the online disk that we provide (you could save extra personal docs there) works like MEGA.nz which again you hold the key!

## Separated data.

The DNB account links to your KTP card. These 2 separate. The online one only holds few game needed datas (like DoB DateMonty-Age-Calc to auto-detect NSFW availability). And the KTP has full data.
The online data often is public, with some variables you can set the visibility. Of course, the Card is always hidden.
The full data digital copy (KTP, birth cert, etc.) is each file. You should download and keep both copies on your disk and online disk just to be safe. Print if necessary. Online disk is alike MEGA.nz, only you have the key, we cannot read if you're not there. We also refuse service if it's not you (surat kuasa, calo, etc.)
